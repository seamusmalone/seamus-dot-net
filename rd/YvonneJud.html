Yvonne Jud Miles: Fashion Model/TruckDriver</H1>
The hail smacked against the windshield.  It  surely 
would be marked by the storm's last whimper. Dead bugs, 
pelted by rain, lay strewn across Y-J's field of vision.  
The drenched and verdant blotches reminded her of Allied 
soldiers bogged down on the clumpy Normandy sand.  It 
wouldn't be much longer till Texarcana, but she'd hafta 
stop and fill 'er up in Memphis.  hoisting her respendent 
frame down form the shiney black cab, she stolled 
gracefully over to the deisel pump.  A man emerged from 
the station's convenience store.  He held a Clark bar, half 
melted from the sweltering dripping heat.  He shouted, 
"You ever done a real man, honey?"  The remark didn't 
come as any suprise; in fact Y-J was used to it by now -- 
she exploded any reasonable definition of attractive.  
5'8", 100 lbs. 36-24-34.  And numbers never lie.<BR><img src=../graphics/ONE.GIF width=20 height=3> 
Soon she was on the road again.  There were no more 
weigh stations left; the remnant of the excursion should 
be tawdry.  Y-J arrived in Taexarcana Friday afternon 
with her load of Mary Kay violet mascara.  Just in time:  
Y-J had overheard, in a diner, about the upcoming beauty 
contest, to be held at the mall.  And everybody, 
participant and  voyeur, Texarcan and foriegner, would 
want to look her best.<BR><img src=../graphics/ONE.GIF width=20 height=3> 
Y-J felt gratified in knowing that  she was providing this 
uncommon service and at the same time was expanding 
the economy, for the benefit of all.  It was time to move 
on.  She was ready to reverse out of the warehouse yard.  
She knew it would be challenging, in her stilletoes.  A 
sudden burst of adrenline would propel her vehicle into 
the onrushing traffic.  One slip would mean a broken heel 
and relegation into fashion illiteracy.  The tension made 
her bustier feel suddenly apparent.  Her body was now 
sheathed in a sticky film of perspiration.  The warehouse 
men watched in cynical anticipation as Y-J placed her 
expertly manicured hand over the receptive gear shift 
head.  Mission completed.  It was now vacation time and 
her urgent destination was the big D- Dallas that is.  Y-J 
reeled towards the metropolis with pubescent abandon.  
The accelorator was floored, levelling out the veficle at 
a good stick double donut.  If traffic stayed light, she'd 
be there in no time.<BR><img src=../graphics/ONE.GIF width=20 height=3> 
 Y-J always felt lost in the huge expase of flat 
landscape.  She felt like blood trickling through the 
incision of road in the prarie.  Approaching the city, the 
road widened, inflating the wound into something 
hideously prostrate, apain that could not be bourne by an 
unwilling soul.  Only a wound to be suffered by a 
masochist; a self abnegation so intense the only possible 
response is delight.  And  the cars and trucks and 
motorcycles were drops of crimson viscous stuff.  The 
city demanded the blood.  The skyscrapers, jutting 
phalluses, demanded the discharge.  All one could 
witness was the pouring in, never a savior, never a clot.  
The buildings were eternal, forever demanding homage, 
the Platonic shrine of the phallus, disembodied from the 
pleasure and the slave to capital.<BR><img src=../graphics/ONE.GIF width=20 height=3> 
Ring!  Y-J was wrested out of her daydream by her 
cellulatr phone - it was Paris.  She picked up the phone.  
"Allo. Oui. Oui. Oui. (pause) Oui.  J'irai &aring; Paris tout de 
suite.  She pulled her cab  int o the long term parking lot 
at Dallas-Ft. Worth International Airport and lept out 
hurriedly.  Arriving at he ticket counter panting, she 
uttered her requests between gasps, 
"Return^ticket^to^Paris^^please."<BR><img src=../graphics/ONE.GIF width=20 height=3> 
The burley balding agent smiled and quired, "Will that be 
smoking or Non?",  Y-J, "Non." Y-J was lucky to get her 
usual window seat.  Lacking her gold trim travel mirror, 
the window would furnish her an ample opportunity to 
make herself up on the flight.  She always abstained from 
patronizing those cramped, smelly on board cubicles 
called "lavatories," they were so vulgar.  Y-J jogged down 
the terminal, ignoring the redundant bedroom-eye 
glances of the bloated oil spoiled bussinessmen, itching 
for an illicit extramonogamous liason.  After an 
uneventful flight, Y-J looked beyond her perfect form-  
as if that were possible.  The hired limo was waiting.<BR><img src=../graphics/ONE.GIF width=20 height=3> 
Glibly negotiating its way through the maniacal Parisian 
traffic down the Champs-Elysees, the car depsoited Y-J 
on the  just off Rue de Rivoli.  She was there to see the 
enfant terrible of the fashion world, Christian 
Bourgeois.<BR><img src=../graphics/ONE.GIF width=20 height=3> 
"Let me explain to you, Y-J," said Christian,  fluted glass 
of Chivas in his hand, medicinal vapours grasping the 
room. "We believe we can pry open a new market.  I just 
got off the phone with  Doria Ferlini, you know the 
exquisite leather designer?  Together we have drawn up a 
new line to corner the S&M market, you know sadists, 
masochists, people into pain? But of course, who am I 
talking to?  Doria's  introductory leather line of the last 
year was recieved with rave reviews in Milan.  But 
Americans, you know, are largely unread in Sade and 
Masoch; it is a pity really.  Notwithstanding, we feel this 
line is so special that even without the theoretical 
yearning to put one or the other partial instincts into 
pracitice, we will sell like nobody could ever believe.  
This will be so because we will hit he heart of law and 
order- Texas.  You don't ahve to be literate you see, just 
law firm handed to enjoy leather and whips.  We will 
manipulate their love of the profane names  of the law 
and funnel it into a produced need for scathing and 
subversive fashion.  It is not another  "Dupe them into 
buying a piece of the European genius," because they will 
think they are invesiting in themselves.  We fabricate 
their image of their own self, appropriate it if you will, 
and show it to them, sell it back to them, under the guise 
of necessity."<BR><img src=../graphics/ONE.GIF width=20 height=3> 
Y-J: "I'm sceptical, what about the animal rights groups 
and cultural feminists?<BR><img src=../graphics/ONE.GIF width=20 height=3> 
C.B.: "Our publicity department's counter-negative-
publicty  division has already taken care of that."<BR><img src=../graphics/ONE.GIF width=20 height=3> 
Y-J: "OK, let's do it!"<BR><img src=../graphics/ONE.GIF width=20 height=3> 
After spending a week in solitude at the spas of the 
Royal Club Evian, Y-J flew the Concord to the U.S..  The 
Bourgeios conglomerate had chose it's beach head from 
which to assault the  Trans-Atlantic expanse: Texarcana. 
Y-J woke after a superflous beauty sleep (after all she is 
Y-J) but nonetheless a psychological tonic for what 
would come.  She limo'd her way down to the mall.  The 
other contestants were already turninhg up.   There was 
some scattered talk among the on-lookers, who were 
suprised to heat that Judy Meads, former Miss Texas, and 
Betty Daimler, of the aristocratic Wisconsin clan, had 
arrived to kick some butt.  "The stakes are higher than I 
thought," Y-J Mused.  Then again she should have known, 
since the event was being  sponsored by AT&T, with an 
excess of $100,000 in cash and prizes.<BR><img src=../graphics/ONE.GIF width=20 height=3> 
Out on the runway came droves of participants.  The 
women onlookers admired the contestants' poise and 
smile; the males wanted to fuck them.  Some people got 
bored and left toting some "AT&T: We'll switch you back 
for free" tote bags.  Some women had chosen to compete 
for a joke; they were no threat.  Some were veterans but 
just didn't have it.  Some were bright newcomers; they 
would not relish theri glory 'til they paid their dues.<BR><img src=../graphics/ONE.GIF width=20 height=3> 
Y-J strode down the runway.  She turned round, held it, 
shot the arrow.  It had to be hers.<BR><img src=../graphics/ONE.GIF width=20 height=3> 
The T.I. Computer tallied the judges' scores.  Second 
runner up: Betty Daimler.  First runner up:Yvonne-Jud 
Miles.  Winner: Judy Meads.  It was a home crowd, but Y-J 
never felt more robbed, losing this stupid suburban 
Polyesterfest when she was the premier avant-garde 
supermodel in the world.  Disenchantment loomed.  Why 
couldn't her cosmopolitan splendor overcome the curvy 
buxomness of this Huston medical student?  Shortly 
after Y-J discerned the real reason:  Judy had performed 
fellatio on the male judges.  Y-J's refusal to do the same 
was probably her downfall.<BR><img src=../graphics/ONE.GIF width=20 height=3> 
So the woman that had smoked the press in Paris, Milan 
and Rome had lost out in a beauty contest at a mall in 
Texarcana.  Was her career over at 25? She didn't cry like 
all those other wimps that lost, but it was a sullen 
moment.  Walking out of the edifice, disconsolate, a 
female, executive-looking woman approached her:  "Hello, 
Y-J?"<BR><img src=../graphics/ONE.GIF width=20 height=3> <IMG SRC="Yvonne'sLegs.jpg" align=right><img src=../graphics/ONE.GIF width=15 height=400 align=right> 
"Yes."<BR><img src=../graphics/ONE.GIF width=20 height=3>
"Hi, I'm Belinda Schenker, regional sales manager for the 
Gap.  I'm aware of the kind of stuff you're capable of 
doing.  My sister still lives in Germany and she told me of 
the stir you made in Cologne."<BR><img src=../graphics/ONE.GIF width=20 height=3> 
Y-J: "Well, yes. Thank you"<BR><img src=../graphics/ONE.GIF width=20 height=3>

"I'm sure you should have won her today but these judges, 
they don't know what to look for.  The point is, that get-
up you have on is really something. Half a dozen weirdo 
kind of people have already been in the store here, 
requesting replicas of your mean leather mini, not to 
mention your stainless steel boustier with  latex 
shoulder cuffs.  We want to hammer out a contract with 
your fashion designer and we want you to be our 
spokesperson in the venture."<BR><img src=../graphics/ONE.GIF width=20 height=3> 
"What would I do?"<BR><img src=../graphics/ONE.GIF width=20 height=3> 
"Commercials, display stands.  In the Dallas area first, 
then maybe Huston, San Antonio.  Your first American 
exposure."<BR><img src=../graphics/ONE.GIF width=20 height=3>
 
"It's going to cost you.  I'll get my people right on it. 
Here's our number, phone and fax."  It ewas Y-J's way of 
not acting too eagerly, the sign of betrayal in any 
occupation where truely proficient aloofness is rarer 
than sincerity.  A new market.  Expanding personal fame.  
A lucrative contract.  And yet... restratint was called 
for.<BR><img src=../graphics/ONE.GIF width=20 height=3> 
"Okay, I hope we can come to an agreement soon,"<BR><img src=../graphics/ONE.GIF width=20 height=3> 
"I have a feeling we will," responed Y-J, spike heeling her 
way across the parking lot, "but first I've got a delivery 
to make."<BR><img src=../graphics/ONE.GIF width=20 height=3>

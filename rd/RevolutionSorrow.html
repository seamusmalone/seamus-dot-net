<H3>I. Desire and Memory</H3>
<IMG SRC="LLenin.jpg" align=right>
	I am almost moved to tears the first time I read these lines.  
Finishing the excerpts from this fifth chapter of Trotsky's book in a 
communist reader, I reread then an I almost cry again.  I feel history-- 
the seventy or so years --  as sinews, palpable muscular extensions.  It 
is as if time and space have exchanged and I can feel a pull from "over 
there", only over there is back then.  I have developed a sorrow for the 
loss of the revolutionary dead and have  irrationally developed a need to 
somehow overcome the distance from their lives and to recoup the loss 
of the revolutionaries living force.  Perhaps today it is more a loss of 
their hope for the future which seems missing.  As we see the co;lapse 
of the Eastern Bloc, to the West it seems that communism is dead (or 
Communism is dead), I realize, however that communism has long been 
dead, but it seems only in its death, as a system, can re-birth become 
possible.  This is horrifyingly mythic, I realize, for a communist to say, 
but we are speaking of a system of thought, a virtual death, not a real 
one.  In some way it forces me to draw the comparison between the 
revolution and those who died for it, who would dialectically  define the 
revolution itself, who in a way gave it value and meaning in choosing to 
risk death.  In this moment I have begun to seek out a meaning for these 
deaths, both the systemic and the animate, and in doing so to question 
the nature of historical method, meaning, and death itself.  Somewhere 
along this path I have begun to construct an image for myself of the 
revolutionary dead to somehow fill this void, at first consoling, and now 
threatening to this whole project.<P> 
	My sorrow began not in the image or the text, but in the aural 
with a song by the Pet Shop Boys, "My October Symphony" (Behavior, 
1990).  I realize it has only been a short while that I have felt this sorrow, 
this change in my sorrow-- that I have given into it, or fully become 
capable of it.  The line "Will they cancel the parade?" is surprising the 
line that strikes me across the sternum, not the section about mourning 
our war torn dead.  I think it is the sense of loss of hope which is more 
compelling than loss of life, with the hope gone, who gives a fuck about 
the living or the dead?  Certainly, it's not that I'm particularly enamored 
with the "parade", the big mobile missile launchers and troops trundling 
weapons erect across Red Square, but the loss of the feeling of 
accomplishment, the great human experiment in the trash bin.  Giving 
up.  My sympathy is not so much for the dead as the living who have 
given up life.  The dead don't give up, they die.  I am at a loss to my 
sorrow, utterly desolute , but I do not cry, I weep tears that run 
singularly, they take a long time to build up, to find enough pressure to 
break from the ducts-- it is a long process, somehow indirect and about 
a certain indirection.  At first this seems to be a sorrow for the dead, 
more and more I realize, it is a sense of loss that comes from my own 
sense of disempowerment, teetering on the edge of despair, while at the 
same time trying to save the possibility of revolutionary practice from 
the same precipice, for in fact there seems to be little I can do to change 
the fate of communism.<P> 
	My thoughts upon reading these lines are however, directed 
not so much at the aural world or at Trotsky's text itself, but at the 
spectral, what I cannot get out of my head is the filmic image of  "the 
revolutionary dead".  It is this image which most fully compensates for 
my lack of memory, I find it incredibly telling that it is an image and not a 
sound or a text which I seek to fill this lack.  The corpses which are my 
immediate image of the revolutionary dead are the bodies of the Soviets 
which were executed by Stalin and later, sometime  after World War II, 
uncovered again,, disintered from their graves in the cold forests of the 
Soviet Union..  I am only aware of this piece of film as a fragment 
collaged in to the  end of Dusan Makavejev's Sweet Movie.  Now 
certainly some of these dissidents were just bourgeois spies and such, 
so there is a sort of contradiction here, but again I at least associate 
these bodies with Trotsky, exiled and assassinated, and those he said 
were truly the revolutionaries of the revolution, not the moderates, 
capable of quelling, the repressing the tides of energy released with the  
Tzar's death.  In comparison, the bodies of Eisenstien's  Potemkin 
seem staged in a way that these bodies from the forest with frost 
clinging to their hair and the clinical camera angles of this archive 
footage do not.  Now in this movie they exist as the revolutionary dead 
and they seem to be so "real", their image evokes emotion.  If Trotsky is 
right, I think, then these might be the "real" revolutionaries.  If these 
men had lived, if the "real" radicals had maintained power in the Soviet 
Union, what then?  But this is not history, it is me slipping into simple 
utopian daydreams, the stuff of movies.<P>
<P> 
<H3>II. Appearance and History<P></H3> 
	I do realize that  I have this  inability to produce the corpus 
dilecti.  I make it re-appear and re-appear, but the corpses original 
presence, its material occupation of space is lost, it is not for me.  Here 
there seems to me to be a contradiction in the very term production, for 
if production means nothing more than to make appear, I have done 
that, and yet frustratingly enough, I have not made the body real in this 
production, I have returned none of its flesh to it.  I have, I think, 
produced the image, the appearance of the corpse, but not the corpse 
itself, but on what grounds do I base such a distinction?<P> 
	These images construct a history of the revolutionary dead for 
me in as much as they seem to make them real, perhaps it is better to 
say they make them appear: for this is not memory, but a photographic 
surrogate for something I wish to have a memory of, but do not. It fills 
my lack of memory, but inadequately-- ultimately it only frames out the 
lack, structures it-- makes the lack "present".Yet this in fact is the key 
to overcoming the  lack itself of transforming the need into a desire and 
realizing the revolutionary potential of a re-evaluation of death.<P> 
	There is the necessity of memory in the communist mind, for 
without memory one can construct neither a history of capitalism to be 
opposed, nor a theory of historical materialism.  Historical materialism is 
immediately ideology when one negates history (I believe it is an 
ideology which looks something like Aristotelian Logical Positivism, if 
I'm not mistaken) . History is always is a matter of memory,  memory and 
history are almost synonymous, were it not for the perversions of 
history and subjectivity itself, I have a difficult time separating the two, 
history is nothing but memory and likewise memory is nothing without 
the "remembered".  My attempts to construct a personal memory of the 
revolutionary dead leave me with nothing but a memory of a mediated 
image, and only a direct, so to speak experience of the mediation.  
Likewise, history must somehow remain actual in the sense of efficacy 
and risk.  History is not an object, it is not a corpse, rather it is the 
embodied phenomenon of regarding the past, of corpse watching.  The 
past is, an object produced (by Klienian logic) from the production of the 
subject, or rather in production of the subject, the production/splitting 
phenomenon existing a priori (in as much as the term is applicable).<P> 
	The past, the alienated object of the labour of memory exists 
like no other object, on an ever changing cusp between "natural" 
alienation and alienated nature:<P> 
1  It is  not an object as all, it is rather a phenomena in itself.  It is a 
phenomenon, a change, now passed-- change done changing in a 
moment, but a movement fixed in having been completed.<P> 
2.  It is not one phenomena, but a complete and interrelated nexus of 
phenomenon which while remaining coherent from certain fixed vantage 
points, exists as uniquely chaotic, disordered and incomplete from 
others.<P> 
3.  Each subject of history cannot be reduced each holds not only its 
own history, but its own history of histories as well.<P> 
4.  History continues to consume us, and as it does so, the presents 
relationship to the past and to the new "edge of history" (what has just 
been) changes the whole of history as a present meaning.<P> 
5.  The moment of history now as we see it is spectral-- residing almost 
completely within the textural or image world.  It is gone, absent, 
removed from us, and yet exists simultaneously as immediately present 
in as much as the past has created the present and is the grounds of 
any future.<P> 
	The past must remain material (in its marking, effecting our 
present material world), without materialism, the past becomes a text 
and not a corpse.  It is in fact the corpse of the parent and at once the 
corpse of the mother and father.  it is the body we lived in and are now 
removed from, but it is also the body we never lived in (it was the 
present as we lived in it) but which provided the code for our existence, 
a donor of some structural foundation.  These ate inadequate terms to 
establish our relation to the past, and yet provide a meaningful 
metaphor for simultaneous psychological existence at once in and out 
of it, in immediate relation and at the same time permanently removed 
from it.<P> 
	The implications of the past as corpse implies a material link 
between "now" and "then" and at the same time we are alienated from the 
past itself, by both the current mode of production, and the nature of 
time itself.  But this does not eliminate the appearance of change, for 
the past, while quite stagnant, changes, if only in relation to the ever-
becoming present.  The presents gives it the appearance of change, but 
this is not the changing of the past, but of our relation to it, that is the 
changing of history.  There is no past, only the appearance of the past, 
there is only history, the past is like a corpse, vacant yet lingering in 
history.<P> 
<P> 
<H3>III. Investments in the Vision of Death<P></H3> 
	I have been hiding, for the sake of the political power 
engendered by doing so, my own personal rubbings with death and my 
psychological investments therein, now I will reveal them.  I do so not in 
order to take a transcendent position, or to more nor in order to 
transcend the social and the political  with the rights of the the subject, 
but in order to free theorizing from any such repressive motives-- to get 
the threat I will produce such an account now so as to dispel and threat 
to the revolutionary and broader tack of my writing.  i think it is safe to 
say that I experienced some sense of loss in not having seen the 
bodies of my father and two grandfathers after their respective deaths, 
but rather than show why I have such an investment in the relation 
between the specular and death, it may show how I contacted it, 
revealed such an investment in the revolutionary .<P> 
	My maternal grandfather died when I was about twelve.  I 
stayed with my paternal grandparents while my parents want to the 
funeral across the state without me.  I was assured that I would not want 
to be there., I would not want to see it.  i remember the construction of  
of images of the funeral in my head, trying vainly to make it real, in order 
to vindicate me from the guilt at not attending (reinforced by my cousin, 
a year older than me who did attend the and let me know what he thought 
of my absence, but would not  tell me what he saw). The images 
constructed were thus gruesome images which I believed to be 
sickening enough to warrant my parents actions.  Disinterment, 
cannibalism, decay, attended by all the ceremony of Catholic High 
Mass.<P> 
	My father died when I was seventeen.  My mother was unwilling 
to spend the money on a casket fort the funeral as my father wanted to 
be cremated and this was an unnecessary expense.  She believed  I 
also did not want to be confronted with his body again.  She also 
explained that she felt the  ritual of viewing the body was dis-respectful 
of the dead person perhaps because they could no longer hide 
themselves, move away, or gaze back.).  The funeral director 
convinced my mother that there  is a need to convey a sense of the 
bodies presence.  A table (or was it an empty coffin? I can't remember) 
was set up in one corner of the room with flowers on it and wreaths on 
easels to the side.  The flowers marked out not  as the funeral director 
had suggested, the presence of the body, but rather the absence.  A 
nest of lack and signification of lack.  (But do I trust myself, I can see 
my father with the thick death makeup, is it an image constructed or 
repressed?  No, constructed I think from the image of a friends brother 
who died in a car accident with n a year of my father, who's funeral was 
held in the same room.  A situation in which, unlike my fathers, the body 
was on display.)<P> 
	When my paternal grandfather died two years later, on the eve 
of New Year's  Eve, there was, I was guaranteed over the phone, 
nothing I could do, no funeral of Wake I could attend, no reason to turn 
back to Michigan after having just returned to Chicago from there two 
days before.  My grandfather was a doctor and a firm  materialist, no god 
was to be invoked in his passing.  I actually shared a good deal of pride 
with my Grandmother in this final rejection of theism, but was again 
deprived of the parting glance which had alluded metwice before.,.<P> 
	Now, there is nothing revolutionary in these deaths, I realize 
that, I don't believe they can be vindicated by history, for the bourgeois 
lifes they ended.  it is this un-seeness and this (perverse, no not turned 
away, turned toward!) desire to see death (even though I have seen it 
and I realize on some level there is nothing there to see, except the 
absences), yet it still haunts me. I don't want to indulge in the narration 
of personal memory at the expense of my real task, but what I have 
revealed must be said, that it not become the repressed and unspoken 
motivation for what I demand to be conscious action, rather I am 
concerned with showing this desire has a very powerful potential to 
make conscious revolution based on the understanding, a respecting of 
history as a possibility for realization.<P> 
<P> 
<H3>IV. Representation and Death<P></H3>
<IMG SRC="pigs.jpg" align=left VSPACE="9"> 
	I find this almost as difficult to deal with as the reality of 
mortality itself, the inability to get beyond the images, to have an 
immediate experience of these corpses.  My inability for death to 
become more than re-production, an image, a text, or a song.  I am 
moved by these reproductions, and the material of the reproductions 
touch me, but as Freud has already commented, I cannot formulate an 
adequate model for death. Aye that is the rub.<P> 
	Still, this emotion I feel, a hollow stomached ache for the 
images of these bodies (regardless) for they re-present to me the 
revolutionary dead to me-- bodies which are lost to me.  As bodies they 
are dead and they are incorporeal for me, simple formal representations- 
mediated, and in this way they are dead as well. but then I can almost 
blame the camera (the gaze) for having killed them, but I realize that the 
only reason they "appear dead" is the mechanical regime of 
reproduction, despite which they most certainly would be dead, but not 
appear, even if there is a certain taint of death in the fixed mediation of 
the mirror.  They are lost the way Roland Barthes speaks of his mother 
being lost to him in Camera Lucida, the mother of that photo taken 
before his birth, a mother which he never knew and yet an image which 
captures his mother completely which as an image rivals her as she was 
in flesh, an image which recalls her, which represents her to him.<P> 
	"Death is not desired, but what is desired is dead, already 
dead: images.  Everything labors in death, everything whishes for 
death.  In truth, capitalism has nothing to co-opt; or rather, its powers of 
co-option coexist more often than not with what is to be co-opted, and 
even anticipate it." {Deleuze}  This serves to create the "appearance" of 
revolution not the revolution of appearance.<P> 
	It has already been pointed out to the point of banlity, the 
relation between the photographic, death and memory; the photographic 
seen as the memory of the dead and the death of memory.  Death is only 
overcome in images by succumbing to it.  But this is also then the death 
of history, or perhaps its origin: its embodiment in the human mind.  In 
fact I believe it is rather both-- certainly from the position of the 
spectacular image- in the culture of capitalism one sees photographic 
reproduction as the death of memory and history through a false 
unification of images and subjectivity.<P> 
	I have to agree with Lyotard, "That which the historian recounts 
and explains had to be real;  otherwise what he is doing is not history.... 
The opposing party against whom the historian argues with all his force 
is not easy to beat; it is death, it is the forgetting which is the death of 
death itself".  Now Baudrillard says the real is that which has already 
been represented, the collision of these two quotations produces what 
seems quite a paradox...But I do not so much take Baudrillard's as 
Deleuze's position which resolves the apparent paradox by determining 
the field on which representation exists, how it is produced: Desire. In 
this we find a new organization of the three epistemes of humanism:  
Death, Desire, and the Law.  Desire produces, it produces the real, with 
or without representation, for desire produces re-presentation itself.  
(but we can concur with Baudrillard for the sake of argument).  "The 
order of desire is the order of production, all production is at once 
desiring production and social production, we therefore reproach 
psychoanalysis ( and implicitly Baudrillard and his investment in the 
Oedipal, although I believe his statement was made later) for having 
stifled this order of production, for having shunted it into representation.  
Further, it changes the desire to overcome death through history into a 
new relation-- the overcoming of repression (capital) with history and 
death, a historical practice which is like death, is simulacral,"Desire, the 
desert-desire, the revolutionary investment of desire.  And that is 
indeed what undermines capitalism:  where will the revolution come 
from, and in what form within the exploited masses?  It is like death- it 
will be a decoded flow, a deterritorialized flow that runs too far and cuts 
too sharply, thereby escaping from the axiomatic of capitalism."<P> 
 <P> 
<H3>V. The Spectacular Image of Death<P></H3> 
	One thing I have not adequately resolved is the distinction 
between the images of death so dominant in current spectacular 
capitalism and the almost invisible bodies of the revolutionary dead.  
The deaths of the spectacle, are fantastic, fictionalized and ultimately 
provide us with a means by which to de-realize death, to distance 
ourselves from it.  I think of how surrounded I am by images of Death.  
These images proliferate to the point that one cannot distinguish 
between the real and the false death.  They become interchangeable 
and yet function as different.  It is at once clear and obscured.  The 
narrative/fictional death is entered into trough an association 
immediately with the represented victim, the journalistic/real death is 
entered into through an uncomfortable association with our own 
mortality.  Both are texts, spectacles of death, but in different ways 
they avoid what can be called a primary area of taboo in capitalist 
psychology relation between death and production.  Death occurs 
outside the law, not in it, even when it is the police or a state execution, 
the question is necessarily deferred.<P> 
	My lover is horrified by the Milwaukee slayings in which a man 
seduced and or bribed young men to his apartment to model erotically, 
only top kill them an perform necrophilial and cannibalistic act on their 
corpses.  She horrified, asks me what this makes me feel.  I believe I am 
supposed to be horrified, yet I cannot make myself, I hold my horror at 
arms length, I wincingly laugh (which testifies to my uneasiness, yes) 
but I cannot imagine myself the victim), I laugh to myself, not out loud, I 
have retained it.  My genera; reaction  this laughter and the words 
unspoken as well, "well that `s capitalism, it's going on all around us, just 
more discretely, like Baudrillard's assertion on Watergate, it is the 
appearance which dissimulates that mass murder is the law itself-- it 
dissimulates the business as usual."<P> 
	Another place we find a consideration of death for the radical is 
Godard's Weekend Godard is aware of the duplicity of constructing an 
image of death-- he clearly shows the opposition in his treatment of  the 
images of death in this film.  On the one hand the dead motorists seem 
terribly (in both senses) staged-- he plays at the mass death 
represented in the media spectacle and at the valuelessness of human 
life in capital.  The death here seems without consequence.  The "dead' 
actors can be seen breathing below a veil of blood.  On the other hand, 
the death of the goose and pig, killed by the cannibal-terrorist-hippies, 
later in the movie, seem to have more of a valence.  This is a record of a 
real death, staged for the camera, caught in narrative and 
representation, but these animals are really killed, offered up for the 
camera, they will never live again.<P> 
<P> 
<H3>VI The Death of Vision and the Vision of Death<P> 
</H3>	Now this brings us to the very inner workings of subjectivity 
itself-- a point which Deleuze and Guattari have shown to be central to 
the revolutionary.  Death is most certainly the dissolution of  
subjectivity, and if we read Lacan straight, vision in the mirror is the 
moment of subjective atomization, the moment the subject fully 
conceives of  its boundaries (although there is a proto subject which is 
rather more boundless in breast relations) <P> 
	One finds Lacan in need of historicizing, or re-historicizing.  
Uncannily one finds the moment of  the historical mirror phase at more or 
less the same time Foucault identifies the emergence of the bourgeois 
subject of humanism.   Foucault quote??  The mirror was among the 
additions to eschatological rituals and subject formation which capital, 
industrialization and mass production presented us.  It has long been a 
custom to close the eyes of the dead, but of more recent origin is 
eschatology is the 16th century is the tradition of covering the mirrors in 
the house.  The irrational superstitious reason for this is to keep the 
spirits from coming in from the mirror world and devouring the confused 
soul of the dead, or of keeping this confused soul from slipping into a 
mirror world of purgatory or hell.  However I would suggest , informed by 
Lacan. something else.  If the mirror is  the (object/relation/image) from 
which the subject is formed, one sees there is a certain way in which 
subjectivity is an economy of the consumed image.  The production of 
subjectivity, the mirror stage is a certain mutual consumption, the mirror 
consumes one's image as one consumes the image in the mirror. When 
dead however, one's vision is no longer active, one's image/spirit can 
be consumed by the mirror, the image of the corpse and yet the  corpse 
can no longer consume the image in the mirror and maintain the 
atomization of the living individual.<P> 
	Perhaps, by this logic the rituals of corpse watching, in various 
forms, are not only extensions of the real threat of corpse robbers, 
common in Europe until the middle of the last century, but also a form of 
ritual consumption of the corpse, a corpse which can no longer turn 
away or stare back.  It becomes then a spectral Eucharist, completing 
the dissolution of the body into spirit, even the consumption of the 
individual is displaced from the body to the bread and wine, to the 
image.  The image had become in this transformation, notably within the 
early object relations with a product of mass-production, hitherto only 
available to the aristocracy, more or less associated with the soul.  To 
consume one visually is to consume one spiritually, a notable rupture 
from Merleau-Ponty's conception of space in "Eye and Mind", but one 
which accounts for the reification of vision in the bourgeois subject and 
notably is that which through a historical turn makes Merleau-Ponty's 
conception of vision as related to practice, and in particular the practice 
of the appropriation of space, so radical.  This is one of the front lines in 
the battle to overcome the bourgeois sensibilities from an aesthetic 
(practical/phenomenal) point of view.<P> 
	The image in spectacular culture is a peculiar matter of 
transubstantiation-- to consume some ones image is to consume there 
inner self.  If the eyes are the mirrors of the soul, then the mirror is the 
eye of the soul.  To consume an image is to devour without touching, 
without {Cannetti's} risk of bodily contact, of being devoured oneself.  
But then this is too simple-- we have learned for ourselves the meaning 
of "that" glance, gaze, or stare.  We are devouring each other, yet 
hesitantly, keeping our distance.  We have learned to forget that the 
stare was only the threat of danger, not danger itself (witness the  P.C. 
codes of sexual harassment), a threat which may, or may not be acted 
on.  The gaze has moved from an ambivalent sign for devouring to an 
immediate sign, a motivated sign for visual devouring itself.<P> 
	In this movement, the image has been detached from the 
"occupying body" which produced it.  This division has perfected the 
Platonic mind/body division and the Christian structures of 
representational devouring in the Eucharist by combining them.  We now 
need only cast our gaze upon the bread and wine-- our gaze must, our 
tongues must not touch them.<P> 
	The consumptive mode in capitalism has always been 
cannibalistic, now in the consumptive mode of the spectacle we find the 
cannibalistic act re-produced, mediated and repressed through its 
transference to the realm of mere signs appropriated visually.  What is 
more, we can say finally what the soul is, not he bread and wine, but the 
system of represent action inferred  by it-- the soul is the image, 
detached from re-presentation itself.  This again would be fully 
concurrent with Lacan-- for if the essence of subjectivity is the soul for 
the Christian and the mirror image for Lacan, in the spectacle  they show 
themselves as one in the same.  One could say this is a real way in 
which the Televangelist are more Christian than Christ, they have a 
better image.  The spectacle with its detached images is truly the 
realization of a new Jerusalem, a just and true Republic.<P> 
	Among the eschatological rituals which were developed by the 
emerging bourgeoisie which bear further light on this topic is the ritual of 
placing coins on the eyes of the dead.  This served the practical 
purpose of weighing down the eyes, holding them shut until rigor-mortis 
set in.  It is a ritual however which places a number of issues on the 
table.  Firstly, why shut the eyes at all, and secondly, why coins?  As to 
the first question, I would suggest, it is a matter of the same closure of 
relations that is suggested by covering the mirrors.  One does not want 
to either be looked upon by the dead, to be visually consumed by death 
or on the other hand, to acknowledge the eventual inability of of one's 
own dead self.  This is problematic, for it would seem that the closure of 
the eyes, like the relation between vision and spirit existed before the 
onset of industrial capital.  As to the second question of why the coins 
should be used as opposed to some other object, to this I have more 
certain answer-- they are, or become, the unseeing surrogate for the 
human labour of vision.  Coins replace, and replaced throughout life 
cleanly and comfortably, all human activity-- but perhaps more than any 
others, these two activities, the production of subjectivity and vision, 
which following a certain logic are quite the same.  It is a means by 
which to deny the nullifying power of death and allow the subject to go 
on living in death as they did in life through their money., This gives new 
meaning to Marx's words in the Paris Manuscripts, "And everything 
which you are unable to do, your money can do for you...  it can 
appropriate all these things for you, can purchase everything; it is the 
true opulence.  But although is can do all this, it only desires to create 
itself..."<P> 
<P>  
<H3>VII. The Death of Communism<P></H3>
<IMG SRC="BushPen.jpg" align=right> 
	With communisms being what they are these days who can 
complain at their failure?  The American Left ha been split into this 
camps those who would naively attempt to defend the indefensible and 
those who simply despair, continue to  idealize rather hopeless about 
the human inability to achieve the utopian.  To conscieve of the 
possibility of socialist is now impossible, how would one go about acting 
as a radical?  Maybe most pressing in my mind is what to do as to 
maintain the work toward communism in the U.S?  We are particularly 
stalemated at home.  One no longer has the model of a working 
revolution, Nicaragua is gone, the Soviets are gone, the Chinese are 
only red in the sense that they have blood on their hands, Cuba is Cuba, 
one is left with a bunch of capitalist, classist systems, Germany has 
been reunified, or as the newsmen put it "East Germany is no more" 
other satellite countries from day to day change power and ideology, 
and are more concerned with national pride than international 
economics.  But what is to me more pressing the general collapse and 
inability of anyone to say much to contextuallize these events from a 
revolutionary position..<P> 
	All things considered, I think it is only by dealing with these 
events that we get to the point.  The revolutionary left is forced to deal 
with its own end of monolithic communism as an affirmation, not the 
death of revolutionary desire, but of revolutionary need.  This death has 
only been camped in the terms of the right, but the pronouncement of 
the death of Communism actually attests to the continued threat to 
capitalism that the revolutionary can actively represent..  That the left is 
stunned by it only shows how easily one is duped into dispair and 
reformism.  The spectre of Communism haunting Europe is dead, it is 
twice dead, if anyone should know the meaning of the double death, the 
negation of the negation, it should be the leftt.  Now that the left is 
believed to be dead we can operate  quitely in the hands of the socious 
unnoticed and unbothered silently engineering he possibility of a 
revolution based on more economic need and well internalized Kantian 
moral imperatives.<P> 
	I'm not trying to like a Trotsky be position- the law is still 
invoked here the good law of Trotsky, treason to Lenin as opposed to 
the Stalinist despotic Law.  Whatever I might disagree with Trotsky on 
that revolution is at least some Stalin in not before her really failed "we 
we're never saved".  Like Benjamin's Angelicus Novus, for the 
revolutionary, it is like a pile of debris, there is no going back to fix the 
things , the lives which have been broken.  Despite the broken lines 
revolution is not a matter of individual success or failure , but theatre 
the survival or extinction of the species.  What can be said moreover in 
Trotsky's defense is that the dissolution of the Eastern Communism has 
everything to do with the continuation of world economic capitalism and 
the impossibility of communism existing and developing as an isolated 
and oppositional system.  Communism really is pointless when so much 
money must go into the  development of Nuclear weapons.  When 
communism is reduced to the struggle for mere survival in an 
adversarial system, with already historically tipped scales it is not able 
to develop-  it becomes like a tree growing like a tree next to a barb wire 
fence disfigured until the wire becomes a part of the tree itself.<P> 
	The dissolution of he Eastern Bloc as, we resign, brought the 
end of the tensions, or some tensions surrounding Nuclear arms.  The 
START treaties underway promise a reprise from the fear of the last 
thirty years.this is an issue of life and death.  But it is a false model, as 
Vaneigem says, there is a world of difference between the struggle 
against death and the struggle for life.  In a workers' newspaper, I find a 
picture of Gorbachev's and Bush exchanging pens made from 
destroyed missiles with which they have signed the start treaties..  This 
is a truly horrifying image.  I do not find the homo-erotic horrifying- not at 
all, it is not the "homo-sexual" implications of two world leaders 
exchanging pens which I find disturbs me.  This exchange even their 
being made from missiles.  It represents to me the change from the 
phallic oppression which the world has come to fear shifting from a level 
of destruction and challenge to agreement and law.  they will work 
together to use the power which was once the missiles to pens, 
agreements.  Agreements which are implicitly possible only in the  
abscense of communism and with the suppression of revolutionary 
practice.  Power moves from the level of potential force to mere 
signification, and the new world order seems quite complete and 
revolution more necessary than ever.<P>

<H3>VIII. Value and Death<P></H3>
<IMG SRC="Stalin_sPajamas.jpg" align=left> 
	Baudrillard says, "Death should never be interpreted as an 
actual occurrence in a subject or a body, but rather as a form, possibly 
a form of social relation, where the determination of the subject and 
value disappears."  So by taking the path of valuing death one is 
reinforcing the systems of exchange and value-- representation of the 
system itself.  Baudrillard also says "death is always simultaneously 
that which awaits us at the systems term and the extermination that 
awaits the system itself."  Baudrillard warns us to an extent of 
overcoding death, or says rather that which cannot be coded, that 
which escapes the code.  Now certainly there is a grain of truth in this, 
and in fact Baudrillard's use of indirection is quite wonderful here, but I 
am rather more concerned with the  moment of the dissolution of the 
code, where is for a moment ceases to be fixed, but still practically 
operates.  For death is quite coded, death is fundamentally rooted in the 
code, for it is perhaps not an overstatement to say that all coding exists 
as an opposition and a challenge to death.  Baudrillard wishes us to rest 
in peace, yet for the living death is constantly coded, i.e. made 
available for systems of symbolic exchange.<P> 
	Respecting the historical fact that in the individual memory 
dies and that the individual, so also goes a part of history, with mass 
death, so goes the collective memory of human life, utterly lost and 
irrecoverable except inadequately in abstraction.  For history in its un-
abstracted form is memory, history is always the abstraction of 
memory, the death of memory, or it is the collective archive of human 
experience, an archive which is lost and destroyed by pillages of time 
itself.  For the radical death is the death of memory, which is the death 
of history itself.<P> 
	In Eric Michaud's essay, "The Real as Primal Scene: a note on 
Devouring", (Utopia-Post-Utopia, MIT, 1989) he contrasts Goya's 
painting "Saturn Devouring his Children", with the Moloch machine in 
Lang's Metropolis.  He writes, "For the substance of surplus value is 
"human life force"; surplus value is human time.  Capital's relentless 
devouring of human time is thus what enables it to grow-- to become in 
Marx's words, "value big with value, a living monster that is fruitful and 
multiplies." the monster speedily consumes faster and faster, bigger 
and bigger portions, surviving and reproducing by incorporating man's 
"living labor", or human time.  The  monster is like time which which gives 
all things and takes them back again-- but it always takes more than it 
gives.  It is like Saturn devouring his children, but they are not his 
children."	If we return to Makavejev's film we see that it  
presents us with a sort of parable about the presence and cruel 
necessity of death to revolution and I think this death is attended by a 
certain sorrow, which is attendant only to the deaths of revolutionaries, 
to those who die in order to make their lives better, for here there  is an 
ironic failure and it is the living, those who do not die who "profit" from 
these deaths.  The film cuts back and forth between the capitalist world 
and the voyage of a ship name "Survival", bearing at the helm, not a 
mermaid, but a huge paper mache head of Karl Marx.  The ship is piloted 
by a woman, "captain Anna Planteta"  very early in the film they take on 
board a young man wearing a sailors hat with Potempkin stitched across 
it..  They engage in child like rounds of sex, bathing and eating, until 
Anna Planeta stabs the sailor to death as they lay, together, post coital, 
in a bed filled with white sugar.  He laughs as he's being killed, he does 
not seem to resent her.  Later a group of pubescent boys are  seduced 
by the older woman into the candy room of the ship,  we find later that 
these children are killed as well in the quest for pleasure and 
liberation,.after their death, Marx's face is graced by a plastic baggy-
tear drop with a gold fish swimming in it.  At the end of the film, Anna 
Planeta is led away by the (capitalist) police for the murder of the 
children.  <P> 
	Capital blames the revolution for the death of revolutionaries, 
as if Capital had itself not made these deaths necessary, as if Capital 
had not made death inevitable for all people, whether measured out in 
small doses or in one premature bullet to the head.  We should see this 
as nothing more than Capital coding the deaths of revolutionaries for 
simple exchange, chaining down the simulacrum of revolutionary risk.  
This brings us back to the question of history and memory.  If 
communism on some level is  the overcoming of the  produced division 
of subject and object, the negation of the negation, then is is also the 
revolution of the indivision of history and memory, this is what is meant 
by the transcendece of history, the transcedence of memory as 
well.<P> 
	Let us not mistake  our point. it is not a matter of producing an 
objective truth of history of the subject overcoming the subsuming 
memory.  It is not a matter of the abstract value of death to the spirit of 
the dead.  It is a matter of life and value for the living. "I shall sow you 
the consummating death, which  shall be a spur and a promise to the 
living."  In re-signing ones self to nothingness, in finally dissolving 
subjectivity one exchanges some value of defined (valued) life for a 
value outside of it, but human life is invaluable and by entering the 
invaluable into the system of exchange without reifying it, the whole 
logic of exchange is disrupted.  " He who has a goal and an heir wants 
death at the time most favorable to his goal and his heir."  the 
revolutionary death pushes everything back to use value.  But not 
Baudrillard's use value as "value", use value as practice, the use-
practice of desiring production.  Baudrillard posits death as the only 
escape from representation, form the coding of Capital, but what must 
be made clear is that practice, and even dying as a practice escapes 
need and the code, rupturing it.  What Nietzsche is really speaking of is 
value of valuing death not a necessarily as a negation of life, but as a 
final affirmation of it, willing death, or risking death, for a reason and in 
doing so recouping the position of producer.  This is also to reestablish 
life within practice as invaluable, any value is produced from life, from 
phenomenon, from desire, not for it.  Let us not make the mistake of 
trying to establish any value of death for the dead, or of fixing an eternal 
value to death in itself.  Rather, I'm seeking a position which 
simultaneously exists as a practical assistance in extermination of the 
system and avoids simply representation good in so doing .  If we say 
the revolutionary death is the good death, without historicizing or taking 
responsibility for our own historical production of "death", we write 
nothing less than a communist Phaedo   History as re-membering (the 
material) begun from, but never complete in respecting the dead.  The 
difference between memory and history is the same as that between the 
subject and the object, all communist activity is an attempt to overcome 
the repression of their co-extensive nature.<P> 
	Revolutions consume men and human energy, but not like the 
Moloch of Capital, and not necessarily like time either, for it always at 
least is attempting to give back more than it  has taken.  It even 
attempts to give back more when what it has taken is life itself, through 
this  remembrance, of the the corpse it  produces a meaning for death, 
values it.  Through liberated production it gives death a Promethian 
justification which escapes the position of model or copy, which 
escapes the reification of reverence.  The value of the life which has 
been sacrificed in liberation, for the first time takes on this true value 
which has been and will be denied it under this mode of production: 
invaluable.  And yet to one death has attained this value today, the 
worth of the life itself.  It remains for those living to give these lives of 
the revolutionary dead the value which hangs in the purgatory of having 
been sacrificed, but not having made communism actual.<P>

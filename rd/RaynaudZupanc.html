	<H1>Raynaud and Zupanc: Tropes of Nihilism</H1> 
Nihilism can be boring, stupid, annoying, depressing, 
romantic,frightening, and even funny.  Two recent shows, 
Jean-Pierre Raynaud's retrospective at the M.C.A., and 
Terri Zupanc's show at the C.C.A., both can be construed 
as playing at a Nihilism of sorts.  And yet they do it in 
such different ways that this in itself is noteworthy, 
especially when one considers the contradiction in using 
nihilism in art at all as a trope, an expression of a 
condition (content) or as a contradiction; for no matter 
how far one pushes it, there is always something there, 
no matter how devalued.  Even in a bell jar, there is the 
bell jar itself to delimit and "define" the space of 
absence.  Even in Klein's empty gallery there is the 
Gallery and the air in it.  If a contradiction is in 
operation, it must be, to apply a bit of theory, a 
productive opposition (Dionysus and Apollo, the producer 
and the object of production) or a repressed opposition 
(the tragic and the Platonic,use value and exchange 
value).  These two artists, both quite accomplished and 
polished as presenters, present this distinction quite 
explicitly.<P>

Raynaud's work, with few exceptions, seems to thrive 
on the representation of a nihilistic sense of loss, i.e. 
lack.  This lack is organized around the loss of his wife, 
who notably did not die, but left him (i.e. willed him 
away, and who wouldn't?).  This is a moment he never 
recovers from but obsessively represents.  Raynaud 
organizes his whole aesthetic production around his 
repressed subjectivity.  His simple representation does 
not free him, force him to deal with his loss, but only 
points it out.  Anyone with even a rudimentary knowledge 
of Freud's work on the subject will realize that the 
repeated representation of a traumatic event is not a 
cure for overcoming the trauma, but a symptom of the 
trauma itself, an indication that the trauma has not been 
overcome and that it will not be until it is consciously 
realized.  Now while the event with his wife is probably  
not really of his own doing, even if it appears to be.  His 
house, which he "bought for" his wife, he has covered 
completely with sterile white tile.  It is a machine of 
reflection.  While he lives in it presently as a little 
repressed man, the house is a representation of his 
repression, a repression of his own repression (the fixed 
Jungian "my house is always myself).  While his 
reflection is clever and quite possibly intentional, it 
does not overcome, or even attempt to overcome through 
a passive critique, the nest of repression which Raynaud 
has engineered around himself.  This machine would have 
been impossible to engineer if it were not preexistent to 
Raynaud the subject's operations. <P> <P> 
Raynaud's house insists upon the isolation of the 
individual engaging in an isolated struggle against 
personal repression and trauma.  These repressions, 
subjective and isolated in appearance, are social in 
origin.  Raynaud's approach seems once again an attempt 
to attack with futility a problem which is only further 
reified.  Raynaud recirculates and re-presents the 
problem on another level but fails to dispel it.  His 
alienation is reified by his symbolic struggle.<P> 
This critique may seem preemptive, considering the 
amount of work which Raynaud has produced for social 
spaces (like Catholic monasteries).  Are these not 
attempts to address the social, to become socially 
engaged?  Only once am I convinced of it: the vacated 
public housing project which he has been commissioned 
to covered in his signature white tile.<P> 
We are told in the catalogue of this show that Raynaud 
represents the merging of two great movements of the 
1960's, pop and minimalism.  Well, yes, but in his work 
they are opposed as a repression of production and not 
production sui generis.  He borrows from the tropes of 
both: the serial, the mass produced, the reductive, the 
grid, but only as it suits his repressed production and his 
production of repression (anti-production).  More 
accurately, Raynaud re-produces both, to recoup them (as 
all art is recouped these days in a matter of a few years) 
as mere signs of symbolic value, detached, uncritical, 
unproductive and immediately capable of exchange.  If 
minimalism ever tried to reach the body; if pop ever 
critiqued the system of (early) late spectacular capital, 
that is lost on Raynaud.  The tropes of pop and 
minimalism are vehicles for him to represent repeatedly 
his sense of lack.<P> 
Raynaud's mourning is simple self-indulgence (oh, 
little me!, oh, little me!!).  He wallows in it.  For the past 
20 odd years he has rolled in it like a pig in mud; no, 
more like a baby in its own shit, but Raynaud is not a 
baby.  He is not the madman clutching the straw in the 
picture he obsessively reproduces, but he has gained 
recognition (and no doubt a good deal of money) posing as 
this madman.  Perhaps this is the sole positive aspect of 
his work, posing as a fictive character he has invented; 
the question is does he realize it is his invention?  A 
simple neurotic, a hypochondriac who only believes (and 
secretly wishes) he is a schizophrenic.  His work is so 
clean, so retentive: he wants to keep it all to himself (No 
one else can see my house.).The moments when he shows 
his work to authority (the art judge), we know the 
meaning of this gift (Look mommy, look, it's for you, I'm 
a good J-P.).   Here in his white tiled W.C., with all of his 
little (no doubt well fertilized) potties (and his big 
potties too!!!) that the flowers don't like to grow in (they 
have, like his wife, learned to keep out of J-P's potties), 
he breeds need and represses desire (one good fecal fete 
and he would be a halfway interesting artist, I'd wager).  
Instead he pots everything, keeps it all clean and 
clinical, in search of pure beauty:"Today pure beauty is 
not only something we need, but it is the only means of 
manifesting in a  pure way the universal force which is 
in all things, [God, shit, exchange value] it is identical 
to`everything unveiled in the past in the name of divinity, 
[damn right] which is indispensable to us poor human that 
we are, to live and find equilibrium, because things in 
and of themselves stand against us, the most material 
world does battle with us {Raynaud}.<P>

Terri Zupanc uses what could be called the "tropes of 
nihilism":the desolate winter landscape, devoid of life, 
flora or fauna, painted in reductive black and white.  
From a distance these paintings may seem little more 
than color field paintings consisting of a large white 
area with a black stripe across the top  of the canvas.  
But then there are the tracks.  These appear as dark 
stripes or spots in the snow, like footprints or tire 
tracks.  Tracks of some life traversing or circulating 
around the barren plane, belying some life through the 
signsof its passing even while the living bodies which 
would lay these tracks are absent.  Some of the tracks 
lead off the plane of representation, while others 
(perhaps) more importantly do not, but recirculate or end 
abruptly, impossibly.  These tracks are indices of bodies 
which have either left off the plane of representation or 
have inexplicably disappeared.  These tracks are divided 
as signs.  On the one hand tracks in the snow are natural 
signs, unlike the linguistic or symbolic sign, which is 
arbitrary.  The indexical sign points to its signified 
because of a "causal" connection.  In this case the 
footprints point to the human, machineor animal who's 
feet have left the signifying mark.  I say divided because 
these footprints are not footprints, but rather painted 
representations of them.  These are arbitrary symbolic 
signs of natural signs.  This system of signs folds back 
on itself productively like an envelope: natural signs and 
signs of nature.  Painting is almost, but not quite, devoid 
of subject and form.  These tracks do not index the 
absence of some wanderer; rather they index the painter 
and the painter's absence in the painting. The marks on 
the canvas, like the tracks in the snow, point to the 
producer; they are traces of the painter's productive 
activity.<P> 
Zupanc's apparent representations break down and 
finally relate not to the reified subject  of the artist as 
privileged producer and master, nor to a Greenburgian 
formalism (they undercuts both) but to the repression of 
the  grounds (and bodies) of production.  If capitalism is 
equitable with the repression of the grounds of 
production, then these paintings are radical paintings for 
they call repeatedly and articulately back to their own 
production {and I say articulately because they call 
equally to the presence of the producer at the moment of 
production (as produced) as to the absense of the 
producer at the moment of consumption (as repressed)}.  
"Here the signifier is neither unproblematicly present as 
substance, nor absent as signification." (La Grice). These 
paintings structure their signifier/referent not by 
indexing the bourgeois atomized individual, but as an 
index of the phenomenon of production which is 
immediately without a subject, to which the subject is 
nothing but an a-postori appendage.<P> 
This is no simple matter, and hinges on the whole 
question of what is that non-linguistic signs do, produce 
their referent as different, or reproduce it (under the 
assumption it exists as an object a-priori).  By taking up 
this question Zupanc no doubt complicates the matter, 
but necessarily so, to do other wise would reduce the 
work to Raynaud's anti-productive re-presentations.  The 
whole question of how a visual sign is structured and 
signifies is no easy matter,  the painting and the image 
are just as undifferentiated as the referent they produce 
through re-presentation, they must in fact be produced 
(and always incompletely) themselves through social 
convention, personal history, circumstance, and possibly 
even language (langue)   Zupanc's paintings are double 
articulations then that re-unify the producer with the 
object even while acknowledging the productive role of 
the spectator's vision-phenomenon.  Ultimately these 
two phenomenon merge,  only when subject and object, 
production and consumption exist together, is the 
repressive aspect of capitalism overcome<P> 
If Raynaud's work is aesthetic, Zupanc's could be said 
to be equally lush and hedonistic.  The paintings play at 
pleasure, at satiating the desire for visual pleasure, the 
desire to gaze.  This position acknowledges the temporal 
nature of desire.  It only creates momentary satiation-- 
not eternal fulfillment.  Hedonism is a recurrent practice 
because it is based on desire and not need {the eternal 
return vs the eternal recurrence of the same (as the 
temporal pleasure v s the eternal end to pleasure seeking  
[or pleasure of the body vs the grace of the soul])}.  These 
paintings beauty relate not so much to Raynaud's call for 
eternal beauty as to Marx's wish that the world collapse 
before one person should go without what they desire.<P> 
These paintings never make a claim to pure beauty as 
do Raynaud's   If in order to continue to produce and find 
a means of resistance, they must in the end be reduced to 
exchange value, how is that any different than Marx's 
reliance on Engel's money, gained through the same 
exploitation they sought to end?  There is no position of 
purity from within capital from which to operate, and 
trying to find one, as I have been reminded is not only 
futile, but infantile.  Resistance then, must always be 
dirty, and accept itself as dirty, the search for purity is 
as reactionary a venture as the search for the maternal 
phallus. <P> 
 I cannot disparage Zupanc's work on the basis of its 
complicity, although it has not, certainly, resolved the 
problem of how to produce art in capital as a 
revolutionary artist, who has?  We must learn to produce 
as revolutionaries from within capital is not a reformist 
"change from inside" solution, but rather it is an active 
challenge to the dogma which has infected revolutionary 
practice like a virus, the repression of the grounds of 
production of revolution.  By saying we are looking for a 
means to operate form within capital only means we 
must if we are to overthrow this system completely, it 
must begin today, and here and not in some imagined 
future.  The need to find the "right" form of resistance is 
just as repressive as any other need.  Certainly we desire 
change, but desire can be acted upon.  The question we 
must ask of Zupanc's work, or any other revolutionary 
artist's is "is it worth while to create prototypes of un-
repressive  production from within capital, even if this 
anti-repressive force is necessarily limited by the 
market from within which it operates?  even if this is 
not an immediate threat to capital and is usurped by the 
market like any other production?<P> 
This shift may seem simple in regards to the social 
problems of capital.  And Zupanc is here at the mercy of 
critics who would demand a more socially engaged 
aesthetic practice  [these are salon paintings after all, 
but in a perverse way salon paintings are much more 
accessible to the general public than guerilla theatre or 
even pop imagery (which demands after all a conceptual-
contextual sophistication in order to be interpreted)].  
Zupanc addresses within the work the fundamental 
problems of capitalism  (implicit in Marx, elaborated in 
Deleuze and Guattari's post-Lacanian analysis) the 
repression of the phenomenon of production.  One is faced 
here with a problem which is considerable-- how to 
show what Zupanc shows in a system which is accessible 
and readable by the socious at large  (Marx of course 
never overcame this problem, the Manifesto is clumsy 
and reductionist, while the Grundrisse and Capital 
remain for the masses impenetrable).  If the theory for 
revolution occurs on such a high level it loses the 
possibility of actualization as a social practice, and as a 
social practice it stumbles over the simplest of 
theoretical problems for lack of basic understanding of 
communist principles then we are truely doomed by our 
own arrogance and ignorance.<P> 
Zupanc's work activly remembers its grounds of 
production, and in at least this it has departed from 
Raynaud's repression.  Raynaud's work is, as art, anti-
production par excellence, "production for productions 
sake, but under the conditions of capital" (Deleuze and 
Guattari), it produces libidinal investments which 
repress desire.  Zupanc's work, while unable to avoid the 
system of exchange, and dependent on this system to give 
the artist time to produce this work itself, I am driven 
to think this is a self-conscious concession to capital, 
not an investment in its repression as such.  Zupanc 
seems to have made theory-paintings, "opposed to 
[Raynaud's] abstactions [these paintings] are concepts or 
objects that make reference to their grounds, [even when 
such reference is implicit, as a reference to late 
capital], in subject-object relation.  Abstractions are 
self-contradictory because they exclude that which is 
necessary to and presupposed  by their existence." 
{Wallach-Bolough paraphrasing Rovatti}  Zupanc not only 
produces self conscious paintings, but necessarily in 
doing so provides the viewer a position through which we 
may become self conscious subjects, "a self conscious 
subject is one that (re)presents itself and knows itself 
in relation to its object and knows and produces (the 
meaning of) its object in relation to itself." {Wallach-
Bolough}<P> 
Neither Zupanc or Raynaud's work should be expected 
to change the world independent of the socious, however 
one can see as we desire to, that Zupanc's work is tied to 
an affirmation which is productive and Raynaud's is anti-
production.While Raynaud's work represses production 
even while it produces, Zupanc's liberates desire and 
production even while repressing (to the extent that it 
can be said a sort of "repression" is necessary to any 
production).  Raynaud emerged at the moment when one 
could see and call for the end of painting, Zupanc's 
perhaps exists at the moment when we might begin to 
see it is possible after all.<P>

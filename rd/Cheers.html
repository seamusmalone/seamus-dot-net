	<H1>Cheers</H1>
 I saw a good rerun of Cheers the other day in which Cliff 
the postman feels that everyone hates him because he 
says offensive/jerkoff/butthead things to them.  Cliff 
pays a guy to perform an experiment on him.  Similar to A 
Clockwork Orange, whenever Cliff says or does 
something unfit, he gets an electric shock from the other 
guy, who's standing across the room with a remote 
control device. Like the other guy can know, for society, 
what is offensive.  You have a punishing device; the 
punishment will be administered, in theory anyway, 
according to an abstract conception that both Cliff, the 
other guy and the rest of the people Cliff talks to 
commonly agree (have an objective definition of) what is  
offensive.<P> 
Punisher: If Cliff offensive, punish him.Society: They are 
always offended when Cliff says something they perceive 
is sarcastic.  They are never offended when Cliff says 
something they perceive is not sarcastic.   Cliff wants to 
modify his behavior into saying what society will 
perceive to be only nice things.  Cliff wants to 
experience pain only when he says something society 
perceives is offensive.  <P> 
Song line flash - Not everyone can carry the weight of 
the world. R.E.M.-"Talk about the Passion."<P> 
As you can by now imagine, there are a number of gaps in 
this setup that we can subvert:<P> 
1. Cliff could say something that in short order he 
percieves that society percieves was offensive, and so 
would want tot be punished, but which the punisher 
doesn't percieve that society percieves as offensive, and 
doesn't punish.<P> 
2. Cliff could say something tht he thinks society thinks 
is acceptable, but the punisher thinks society perceives 
to be unnacceptable, and punishes Cliff against his 
will.<P> 
3.  Cliff might not think his language offensive to 
society, and the punisher likewise, but society thinks it 
is, yet Cliff still doesn't get punished. <P> 
4. Cliff thinks his language offensive to society, and 
society thinks it is, but the punisher doesn't think it is 
offensive to society and doesn't punish Cliff.<P> 
5. Cliff thinks his language offensive to society, and the 
punisher likewise, but society doesn't think it was 
offensive, yet Cliff is punished anyway and so on, and so 
on. . .     <P> 
A problem that emerges already I call the Garden of Eden 
problem: Is Cliff being innocent or bad?  He doesn't really 
"know" he's offending people, so he's bestowed his trust 
in the punisher to act as a surrogate in this regard We as 
the viewers can never crawl inside Cliff's mind to tell if 
he's a willing sinner, if Cliff can even know himself.  So 
as we objectify the power to punish into the hands of god 
or of the courts (eternal damnation or the electric chair), 
Cliff willingly subjugates himself to a man with a 
punishing device.<P> 
The ideal would be that what comes of of Cliff's mouth is 
interpreted exactly the same way by Cliff, the punisher, 
and society. Cliff would be speedily punished every time 
he says something offensive, and always not punished 
every time he didn't offend someoneIn reality, 
misunderstandings will arise, probably frequently, noting 
that there are three parties involved, and that Cliff 
spends virtually all of his leisure time in the bar.  <P> 
Furthermore, the bar is usually jam-packed with people.  
The punisher may get tired because of the immense 
amount of time Cliff wants him to keep his eyes on him. 
He may, in his drowsy condition, miss an offensive 
remark, orinadvertently hit the buzzer.  Also, the 
punishment mechanism may not work because of an 
internal disorder (e.g. the batteries could be weak or 
dead).  The shocker may malfunction and shock Cliff by 
itself.  Cliff might get punished, whether what he says is 
or isn't offensive, by stubbing his toe against a barstool, 
or having Carla accidently pour a pitcher of beer down 
his shirt.<P> 
     Finally we come to assume<P> 
1.  Cliff always wants to be punished when he says 
something he thinks society will perceive as 
offensive<P> 
2.  This generates a reflexivity: That society's power to 
punish a specific act defines that act as offensive as 
much as the offensive act warrants and demands the 
punishment.  Just as much as Cliff feels he must be 
punished for offending, by being punished, he knows that 
he has offended.  The justice system is complete in 
justifying itself.<P> 
3.  Cliff hopes that the apparatus is capable of working 
when activated.<P> 
4.  Cliff never wants to be punished when he says 
something he thinks society will think is 
nonoffensive.<P> 
5.  He hopes the punisher will be able to distinguish all 
of his nonoffensive remarks.<P> 
6.  Cliff hopes that the punisher is always able to 
perform his duty.<P> 
7.  Cliff is capable of feeling pain.<P> 
8.  Cliff desires to be "reformed" into  saying only what 
society believes are nice things.<P> 
9.  Society always interprets things Cliff says in the 
same way, i.e. everytime Cliff says , "You're an ass hole," 
a person is offended; every time he comments, "That's a 
nice dress you have on," a person would take it as a 
compliment.  A person would never take the former 
remark as a compliment or the latter as derogatory.  In 
addition, there is no middle ground, in which a` person 
could find a comment mixed, partly complimentary, 
partly sarcastic, like "Is that only ten beers you've 
had?"  The other person would be confused whether to 
think that Cliff was insinuating he couldn't drink that 
much, or that Cliff knew he could drink many more beers, 
and was just giving him a word of encouragement.<P> 
10.  Cliff wants his peers to think of him as a nice 
person.<P> 
11.  When activated, the punishment apparatus will 
always work in the correct way, always dishing out an 
electric shock, of the right voltage, enough to produce 
pain, not enough to kill or seriously injure, and only this 
shock (nothing else).<P> 
12.  Other coincidences (stubbing toe on bar) don't happen 
to Cliff in the sourse of the procedure.<P> 
13. What Cliff, punisher and society deems offensive is 
ideally the same.<P> 
14.  For Cliff, saying offensive things is a sickness of 
which he must be cured and changed into the healthy 
specimen who says and does nothing offensive. <P> 
15.  It is different if Cliff stubs his toe accidently 
rather than being shocked if he says something offensive, 
because the toe-stubbing is absent the power relation 
between the punisher and Cliff.  <P> 
16.  Cliff must be subordinated and humiliated vis a vis 
the punisher for reform to be successful.  Cliff is not 
interested in punishment for its own sake, but only as it 
acts as a catalyst to reform him.  (see Foucault's 
Discipline and Punish)   <P> 
Any generalization to be drawn from the operation of 
justice in this procedure must fall back on the audience - 
us.  The episode was staged; in all likelihood Cliff did not 
get shocked, it was simulated. "Cheers" is one of the 
most popular shows on TV, ever.  This episode was run in 
syndication, so they must have thought it would 
accumulate a sufficient level of rating to show it once 
more.  We enjoy the staging of Cliff's being shocked.  
Most of us don't think it's profane, we think it's funny.  
We may think Cliff was unwise in making himself ascetic 
in this way.  "Damn it, we don't want the remedy to be 
effective!"  We want the old Cliff back, the one that tells 
people off, the one that just doesn't know any better.  <P> 
He offends people, sure, but it's a small price to pay for 
the entertainment he provides by making a fool out of 
himself.  And to Cliff, he does not degrade or humiliate 
himself by doing this; au contraire, he relishes it.  When 
the rest of the bar realizes what hell Cliff put himself 
through so they would like him, they found out that they 
did like him already, a heckuva lot.  They learned to take 
his comments w/a grain of salt.  His lewd comments 
were better than a justice system worse than the 
Spanish Inquisition.  It's funny to note that the same 
leftists who decry the Spanish Inquisition, a forceful 
attempt to restore homogeneity in religious thinking by 
torturing dissenters, breaking their bodies and minds, 
want to do the same thing to people who do not conform 
to the new "just cause." With more advanced 
surveillance techniques and subtle manipulative means 
by the spectacle to make us desire our repression, the 
Inquisitional style of justice isn't even required 
anymore: it's a lot easier to push people to monitor and 
censor their own thoughts and actions.  Long live Cliff 
the antihero!<P>

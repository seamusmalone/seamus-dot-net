	<H1>Lite Beer?</H1>
 In movies and TV shows, whenever people come into 
contact w/water, you can bet it will be a romantic scene.  
Swimming pools, lakes, showers, doesn't matter.  And all 
those beer commercials where a woman holds a garden 
hose, gushing its load.<P> 
When a guy walks into a seedy bar and every guy already 
in there looks like ZZ Top's road crew: fight.<P> 
With this whole attack on "polluting" images of sadism 
and violence, I watched "Marked for Death"w/Steven 
Seagal a few days ago.  At issue is not only how, and 
w/what intentions images are produced, but how and 
w/what intentions are they consumed.  I thought this 
donnybrook of a film, w/its mandatory barrage of gunfire 
and gory deaths, was funny. Honestly.  It was so inane 
that I cracked up several times.  Some of Seagal's lines 
went something like this.<P> 
His relative: "Oh, no!  I think they [the bad guys] are 
coming to get us."<P> 
Seagal: "Somehow, I don't think they're going to get the 
chance."<P> 
 Seagal's character doesn't realize that the drug kingpin 
he must kill is actually a set of twins.  So after he kills 
the first one, he sees the second one and it surprises the 
shit out of him. Finally at the film's end, when the 

second twin plunges to his death, our hero muses, "I sure 
hope they aren't triplets."<P> 
The visual and oral images were hilarious.  It was like 
'Batman'  from the '60s, although they didn't intend this 
movie to be interpreted like that.  Which brings me to the 
point What the artist intends to put across to the 
audience isn't necessarily how the audience will 
interpret it.  When we view a` vintage 1950s "Zorro" 
film, do we interpret it the way people did 40 years ago?  
Do I interpret it the way my father does today, boyish 
blue eyes and quarter-inch military haircut stalking the 
set for the next victory over lawlessness?  Why are the 
old Zorro films funnier than "Zorro The Gay Blade," which 
is supposed to be a comedy, whereas the intention of the 
old movies was to promote the notion that the only way 
to preserve the law was through lawlessness?  Why do I 
split my sides over these?If I owned a video shop and had 
my druthers, I'd stock `Marked for Death' in the comedy 
section.<P> 
Most porn films are funny to me. The dialogue is more or 
less"Ooh."  "Aah."  "Ooh."  "Aah."  "Oh, baby."  "Oh, don't 
stop."Come on, it's funny.  The problem w/the antiporn 
people is to them, there is only one correct way to view 
participants in smut films and shows: as objectified, 
degraded, humiliated....  Perhaps many of the 
actors/actresses do feel that way, but about the best 
way to explain the feeling of those that don't is, and pay 
attention because you'll hear this phrase ad nauseam, 
"They've internalized patriarchy."<P> 
For the Christian, sin is the cause of all grief in the 
known world; for the academic Marxist, residing in their 
cubicles, it is capital; and for the cultural antiporn 
feminists, all bad descends unidirectionally from the 
rubbish heap of patriarchy.  Most of Western philosophy 
from Plato onward puts human behavior and thoughts into 
two categories: what people did and what they ought to 
have done.  The crusade against violent and pornographic 
images is the latest unfolding of this idiocy.  They say, if 
people are spiteful, deceitful, violent, sadistic and 
masochistic, horny, jealous, lazy and generally a `pain in 
the ass, they don't really enjoy being that way.  In 
their`delusion, they are unaware of their `true' calling.  
This all-encompassing argument renders cries to do 
something constructive about the actual acts of violence 
against women, gay men, lesbians and ethnic minorities 
in our society laughable. The Dworkin who cried wolf.  Is 
it possible that we could enjoy producing and consuming 
S&M images while not wanting to be raped or beaten up?  
This is a reality for some people (perhaps me), but a 
reality that the Dworkinites will not entertain.  D.H. 
Lawrence derided pornography as an attempt to do dirt on 
life.  Of course, Mr. Lawrence was pristine in every way, 
and never allowed impure thoughts to run roughshod over 
his reason. Every sensible person knows that with the 
right level of moral fortitude, we would never even 
consider dirtying our lives.  That's why I didn't see 'The 
Last Temptation of Christ,' but tried to get it banned 
from my town.  When that didn't work, I picketed outside 
the movie theater and tied down some of the scrawny 
pencil-neck stragglers that wanted to patronize the 
establishment.  After all, I'm the only person who knows 
what they really want.  I wonder if it's out on video yet. .

HOLLYWOOD - After  a barrage of protest against Seagal's 
Zen brutality, and his persistence to carry on acting only 
in such masculine roles, the movie company dismissed 
him.  An industry spokesperson said, "The inside word is 
that Seagal's being replaced by Fred Rogers.  The 
tentative title of his new film is Mr. McFeely's Poisoned 
my Fishtank, So He's Got Some Warm Fuzzies Coming to 
Him.<P>

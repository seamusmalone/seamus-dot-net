<H1>Situationist Comedy?</H1>

 If the medium is truly the message, as Marshall 
McLuhan so openly asserts, the message of today's TV, 
network or cable, is Brain Rot.  From the suburban 
mayhem of `<I>The Brady Bunch</I>,' to Dr. Marcus Welby, who 
after having treated his patients, followed them around 
for, like, years, to `<I>Diff'rent Strokes</I>,' where a 
philanthropic white millionaire adopts two young black 
Harlem boys (see, poverty is the white man's burden and 
to be altruistic to is to exert power over), we have 
awaken from are sedation and we are bored.  All that 
cable has done is to re-present us with the stuff we 
were already fed up with 10 years ago.  Calgon&copy;, take me 
away!   <br><img src=../graphics/ONE.GIF width=20 height=3> 
Luckily, some dramatis personae took it upon 
themselves to give us more.  Who hasn't thrilled to the 
Pop Art-ish antics of the 1960s `<I>Batman</I>'?  The 
archcriminals liked their outfits so much that they even 
kept them on in jail (and what hardened murderer 
wouldn't be turned on by Frank Gorshon's Riddler 
pygamas?).  If superficial shows reflect our superficial 
lives, and equally, vice versa, postmodernism suggests 
that all has been attempted, every nuance has been tried.  
Our remote control-wielding fingers are caught in the 
rusty hinges of late capitalism; what remains is to 
formulate a simulacrum of entertainment in the guise of 
the spectacle of Entertainment.   <br><img src=../graphics/ONE.GIF width=20 height=3> 
`<I>It's Garry Shandling's Show</I>' was a bold instance of 
self-deconstructive critique in situation comedy.  Until 
recently broadcast on Showtime and Fox, Shandling 
involved his live`amera operators at every step.  He 
parodied himself as the show was in progress, such as 
sitting in his living room, watching a video of his 
show,during his show.  We could relate to his neurotic 
obsessions (e.g. hair) and his dorky friends (Leonard, 
Grant Schumaker).  In one episode, he is on a date.  He 
goes back to the woman's house and they are sitting 
there watching `<I>Gilligan's Island</I>.'  The date was just 
bombing.  His date sat there, singing along with the 
theme song, Garry is sitting there thinking about how the 
crew can't get off the island and how he can't get out of 
this loser date.  I'm almost halfway finished, how do you 
like it so far?   <br><img src=../graphics/ONE.GIF width=20 height=3> 
A sterling sitcom, although a one season wonder, has 
to be Chris Elliott, Jr.'s `<I>Get a Life</I>,' on Fox.  Elliot stars 
as Chris Peterson, a 30-year old paperboy in a small 
Minnesota town.  He still lives at home with his parents, 
with his real life father playing his dad.  The plot 
revolves around jr.'s futile attempt to put some meaning 
into his worthless life, yet it turns out to be exciting 
anyway, pretty much by accident.  Cool episodes include 
Peterson starring as a wildebeest in a zoo animal disco 
musical on rollerskates, and a soap parody, in which he 
meets a beautiful model, falls in love, marries her, has 
an affair, a fight, and gets divorced, all in an afternoon 
(a 30 min. show).  All the more tragic because it was 
love at first sight:<br><img src=../graphics/ONE.GIF width=20 height=3> 
Model: "What's your favorite song?"<br><img src=../graphics/ONE.GIF width=20 height=3> 
Chris: "`Billy, Don't Be a Hero.'"<br><img src=../graphics/ONE.GIF width=20 height=3> 
Model: "So's mine!"<br><img src=../graphics/ONE.GIF width=20 height=3> 
References to consumer products, in innocuous 
contexts, abound: "I'm going to treat you to a traditional 
Peterson Sunday breakfast, lots of bacon and Sprite&copy;."   
<br><img src=../graphics/ONE.GIF width=20 height=3> 
An interesting new show of the TV season is 
`<I>Herman's Head</I>,' on Fox.  It stars a guy, Herman.  
Whenever he thinks about stuff, there's this whole group 
of people inhabiting his head.  They slug it out over which 
course of action Herman should follow.  The group 
consists of a dweeby moral guy, an intellectual, mature 
one, a female with a mystical, spiritual side, and a slob 
who wants to gets drunk and laid all the time (he's my 
favorite).<br><img src=../graphics/ONE.GIF width=20 height=3> 
Methodologically, this show is potentially radical.  
Whereas Shandling established a rapore with his 
audience and the camera, Herman introspects himself: 
deconstructive in a different way.  Yet `<I>Herman's Head</I>' is 
wrought with numerous problems.   <br><img src=../graphics/ONE.GIF width=20 height=3> 
As with every mainstream TV show I can remember, 
the voyeur is still the man.  It is Herman the male who 
imagines what that woman would look like without her 
clothes.  I'm not saying that it's wrong to wonder what 
people look like naked, but that every viewer, regardless 
of gender, sees the world through the `masculine' 
perspective.  Herman is white, straight and middle class, 
so the same arguments could follow here, too.  So 
although the form is radical, the content, what the 
Herman character `is,' lags far behind.  The audience is 
forced to adopt the voyeurism of the dominant segment 
of society.   Which is not to say that there aren't ways of 
subverting this; see for instance ways the Situationists 
suggest (e.g. Guy Debord).<br><img src=../graphics/ONE.GIF width=20 height=3> 
Another equally disturbing facet of the show is its 
moralism. Herman has the chance to fuck a woman, and 
indeed that is the intention of the slob in his head.  Alas 
the holy Trinity of the other three inhabitants merges to 
form the Platonic truism that order in the Republic can 
be preserved only if Reason holds the base passions in 
check.  Herman ends up not sleeping with the woman and 
he is rewarded; she really respects him and thinks he is 
exceedingly romantic because of his moral fortitude.  Of 
course in real life, 90% of straight guys would've gone 
for it, but capitalism will not favor art that isn't its 
propaganda tool.  Even `<I>Married with Children</I>' which at 
first glance appears to be a renegade challenge to 
traditionalism (e.g. the characters are cynical and are 
slobs), defines itself as the anti-family  program,  in  
reaction to the `legitimate' Platonic idealism of `<I>The 
Cosby Show</I>.'<br><img src=../graphics/ONE.GIF width=20 height=3> 
Our present situation does not favor art in which the 
characters desire to, and willfully do, lose their 
self-control: the antithesis to Taylorization, the 
rationalization of production, efficiency, and its 
concomitant society of surveillance, which Foucault so 
eloquently critiques.  There is a good passage by 
Nietzsche in <I>The Birth of Tragedy</I>.  In it, he writes that 
Greek tragedy was killed off by the type of productions 
that Plato and his disciples favored, ones that would 
inculcate moral values and a sense of civic virtue in the 
polis.  Here is a victim.     <br><img src=../graphics/ONE.GIF width=20 height=3> 
PeeWee Herman has gotten a bad rap.  I'm not going to 
get into an infantile argument against the hypocracy of 
moral puritanism in our society, nor against cultural 
feminists who say that Herman must be a sexist for 
patronizing the establishment he did.  Those factions are 
wrong here, but I want to discuss PeeWee's brilliant 
show, `<I>Pee Wee's Playhouse</I>,' until recently shown on 
CBS.  If there is one show on Sat. mornings that 
encouraged kids to create instead of being receptacles 
for garbage, to challenge instead of accepting, to think 
freely instead of sitting there to be raped by docile 
consumption, it was PeeWee Herman's show.  He 
challenged gender roles (c'mon, that genie was a 
flamer!), racial stereotypes (the African-American 
Cowboy) and in the end dispelled the myth that all 
children's characters are, or should be, squeaky clean 
with their morals.  The problem now is the Watergate 
problem (see Jean Baudrillard's discussions): Now that 
the `criminal' has been caught, now that the moral order, 
the myth upon which this rickety heap of lies we call our 
democracy stands has been purged, we can accept 
uncritically everything that will be fed to us in the 
future.  It is beneficial for a system such as ours to have 
a Nixon, a Herman, a Milli Vanilli every once in a while, 
to identify them as conspirators; it tends to reify the 
`legitimacy' of a whole rotten system that can pass off 
the untruth that is  pure and the ideal to which we aspire 
and should want to preserve.<br><img src=../graphics/ONE.GIF width=20 height=3>

	<H1>Marx on Freedom of the Press
</H1><P>
At first it is startling to find  freedom of the press subsumed 
under  freedom of doing business.  Yet, we must not condemn 
the views of the speaker out of hand.  Rembrandt painted the 
mother of God as a Dutch peasant woman, and whgy should not 
our speaker paint  freedom in an image  that is immediate and 
familiar to him?...<P> <P> 
To defend or even understand the freedom of a domain, i must 
grasp its essential charachter rather than its extrinsic 
connections.  But is a press true to its own charachter, does it 
behave in accord with the nobility of its nature, is the press 
free, when it demeans itself a business.? A writer must of 
course earn a living to exist and be able to write, but he must 
in no sense exist and write so as to earn a living.<P> <P> 
When Beranger sings<P> 
<i>Je ne vis, que pour fairee des chansons,<P> 
Si vous m'otez ma place, Monseigneur,<P> 
Je ferai des chansons pour vivre.</i><P> 
<P> 
There is an ironic avowal in this threat: the poet falls from his 
domain, as soon as his poetry becomes but a means.<P> 
In no sense does the writer regard his work as means.  They are 
ends in themselves.; so little are they means for him and others 
that, whrn necessary, he sacrafices his existence to theirs, and 
like the preacher of religion, though in another way, he takes 
his principle:  "God is to be obeyed before men."  He himself 
with his human needs and desires is included among these men.  
Nonetheless, suppose that I have ordered a Parisian frock coat 
from a tailor, and he brings me a Roman toga because it is more 
in accord with the eternal law of Beauty!    The first freedom of 
the press consists in its not being business.  The writer who 
debases it to a material means deserves a punishment of his 
intrinsic lack of freedom, the extrinsic lack of freedom, 
censorship; better yet, his existence is already punishment.<P> 
<P> 
<body text=ff0000> Better that the whole world should be destroyed and perish 
utterly than that a free man should refrain from one act to 
which his nature moves him.<P>

	<H1>Milli Vanilli
</H1>
Much has been made of the Milli Vanilli debacle.  They 
have been accused of lying, lacking talent and being 
pontificating egotists. It seems as if I am the only 
person who will defend their just cause.  Not long ago, 
the Millis were basking in the glow of their duly earned 
Grammy award for best new group.  Millions of teens, the 
world over, relinquished their money and leisure time to 
the new gods of the techno-dance age.  All of us know of 
the circumstances leading to the Millis' ultimate 
demise.<P> 
To respond to these malicious and defamatory 
charges, brought against them by people ed to be blunted, 
that of synth-rock. These groups from the 1970s (e.g. 
Genesis, Yes, Kraftwerk) were tried for treason v. the 
same puritanical constitution.  The groups' keyboards 
produced an artificial sound that made the blasphemy of 
original rock seem pale in comparison.  Alas, corrupt 
people must have found something worthy about the 
newer, progressive bands' noises, as millions of their 
albums infiltrated world homes.  As an aside, might I add 
that during the 1960-70s, an equally pointed controversy 
was erupting, over whether the consumption of illegal 
narcotics was a perquisite to appreciate the sonic 
onslaught of psychedelia.  What would Timothy Leary 
say?<P> 
The 1980s saw the outbreak of sampling. Artists were 
ripping off preexisting material from films, politicians 
and other artists. Detractors cried foul: "How can you 
play copyrighted material - that's cheating?"  Right.  And 
that's the best part about it.   So here we are in 1991.  
Today's artists employ all of the aforementioned 
techniques.  All are more or less respected.  The techno-
wizards use samples, replayed in sequences, possibly on 
backing tapes, in their `live' performances.  Hardly a soul 
raises a fuss.<P> 
  In the MTV generation, to quote Andre Agassi, "Image 
is everything."  Milli Vanilli is a testament.  The hype, 
playing the part, the spectacle is astronomically more 
important than the music.  Isn't the real reason you're 
ticked off over Milli because you thought you had every 
group pinned down where you wanted them, somebody 
else did the singing -were we entertained any less?  If 
you found out that some morticians did the singing on 
every Beatles song, would you treasure them, and the 
memories they bring to life, any less? Before you kick 
sand in Milli Vanilli's face, start asking some questions 
about Norm from the Elk club.  Lay off Milli Vanilli; in 20 
years they'll be reality.<P>

<img src=../ONE.GIF width=12 height=3>Red Dionysus is not a political party, organization, 
front or army.  Red Dionysus is a corpus, a political body, 
an acting force.  It is an acting force which only 
represents itself as unified.  Red Dionysus is a fictive 
subject-- the production of a desire for an identity, an 
individuality.  If this fiction represents itself as an 
author, it is a matter of a fiction authoring itself-- for 
only through its production does it become real; 
incorporated.<br>

The Red Dye is not the blood of the revolution, but a 
signifier for the blood , a simulation.  In turn, the blood 
is a signifier with a signified, but clearly lacking a 
referent  , not that we have failed to see the blood , 
we've failed to see the revolution.  The Dye acknowledges 
the depth of its falsehood, it presence as an absent 
force, the structured absence of the revolution.  Further 
Dye is not an object, rather the active to dye, to stain, in 
a system of reification, it is always the action which is 
lost to the objectities.  It is Dye which is organized into 
images and letters but self-conscious -- never 
forgetting in its productive-consumption that it is a 
matter of paper and ink-- desiring that in the 
consumptive-production of the other as reader it will be 
re-membered that reading itself is a matter of actively 
producing a relationship with the material basis of that 
production (the signifier paper and ink makes the 
material grounds of production its referent) actively 
producing a relationship with paper and ink, producing a 
subjectivity in the tension between the socius and the 
producer-as-reader's relation to it's object.<br><img src=../ONE.GIF width=12 height=3> 
Today, as our only redemption lies in passive 
consumption in which we have objectified pleasure, in 
the consumption of overdetermined codes, redemption 
through consumption becomes the consumption of 
redemption.  Shopping is the Eucharist of Spectacular 
Captialism-- through the appropriation of codified 
products, the buyer becomes one with the transcendental 
signifier of capitalist phallocentric power.  Object and 
trademark are the bread and wine, dislocated signifiers 
lacking any signified, much less a referent.  If everything 
has been reduced to mere signs to the extent that the 
signs themselves must call on higher and higher orders 
of representation merely to signify their own 
existensense, then the proper reasction is not to simply 
re-assert the referent, but also to re-present the 
materiality of the signifier.  The referent can be 
immaterial, just as the signified always is, but the 
signifier is necessarily immanent. Here.<br><img src=../ONE.GIF width=12 height=3> For Dionysus the wine is the source of disruptive 
power, not an arbitrary signifier, but a trace, spilled 
wine is a mark, a demarcation of memory and of acting 
force.  Blood for Dionysus is not a lost signified of  
wine--the blood of the revolution, of salvation, but a 
referent in itself to the material grounds for 
signification, of production.  Wine is the disruption of 

logic and

representation, undermining the regimes of 
positivism, repression, inactivity.  Wine changes the 
perception and forces the drunken to re-establish their 
relation to objects, to take a new position in relation to 
them, to remember the grounds of both subject and 
object's production in the phenomenon of desire.  If wine 
is a dye, a stain, it is not an arbitrary.linguistic sign, but 
a trace. A stain in the clothes of the dancers which 
recalls the festival, the political moment when  the 
principium individuationis dissolves.  Wine is not a tool 
of forgetting, but of the whole Dionysion phenomenon of 
tearing apart and re-membering of the political body of 
the socius, of mind and body, theory and practice, subject 
and object.  This is the core of the productive dialectics 
which are discourse, which do not rely on the fixity of 
any meaning, of any sign.  If this seems suspiciously 
bourgeois to you, I'll cite Marx's words which declare 
that, "communism as completed naturalism is humanism, 
as completed humanism is naturalism.  It is the genuine 
resolution of the antagonism between man and nature and 
man and man.  It is the true resolution of the conflict 
between existence and essence, objectification and self-
affirmation, freedom and necessity, individual and 
species.  It is the riddle of history solved and knows 
itself as this solution" <br> 

<img src=../ONE.GIF width=12 height=3>Even while REaD Dye is a text, it is a project to 
overcome the regime of writing-- the repressive power 
of the text not only opposed to the logos, but also textual 
deconstructionists happy enough in their tenured position 
for deconstruction to remain


 signified as radical.  But 
like the signs it critiques a radial sign without a 
signified is meaningless unless it has a referent:  radical 
action. While we acknowledge that radical theory is 
radical action, to borrow a phrase from a conversation 
between Deleuze (who said it) and Foucault (who heard 
him say it) it is a partial action-- and even while we 
love the partial as production, this time it is simply not 
enough.  Certainly the division between theory and 
practice must be broken down from both sides, we 
ironically find we have to turn Deconstruction on its 
head"It is not enough that thought should seek to realize 
itself; reality must also strive towards thought." <br><img src=../ONE.GIF width=12 height=3> 
REaD Dye from the title on demands an active reader 
willing to acknowledge the act of reading as a productive 
practice.  And a reader willing to acknowledge the 
necessity to act on reading imbedded within the 
polyvalent title REaD Dye, RAD, RED, READY, the 
preponderance to action which comes with useful 
knowledge.<br>

Red Dionysus seeks a revolution without subject or 
ideology.  A revolution based on desire-- Desire 
overcoming need, revealing need as a production and not 
as a basis for desire.  A revolution without a subject is 
not a production divorced from subjectivity-- but rather 
sees the subject of history as the subject for history-- 
inhistoricis, in production.

It contradicts the liberal 
moral rights of the subject as the foundation of a 
revolution.  Every revolution actively violates these 
rights in  the production of the revolution itself, people 
die. Rights, morality are not the grounds of any 
revolutionary action, but rather the suppression of 
action, and thus necessarily revolutionary action as well.  
Desire is the only actual basis for revolutionary action, 
the desire for the freedom of desire.  Desire is the 
liberating force of the socius, just as the socius must 
become the material grounds of desire.<br>

We seek not to liberate the subject, the liberation of 
the subject has always been the liberation of the 
bourgeois individual.  Nor do we seek the liberation of 
the state, the liberation of the state has always been the 
liberation of the bureaucratic system.  We seek the 
liberation of the socius, of societies production-- 
culture.  Along with culture comes the subject-- but not 
the individual, rather the character, the subject as 
fiction, not as a reified subject in capitalist production, 
but the character of the body which is the acting force of 
production, desiring-production.<br><img src=../ONE.GIF width=12 height=3> 
Specific situations must become the material basis of 
radical theory, and radical theory must become a real 
weapon for the  the historical production of resistance 
and revolution.  History here becomes not a teleological 
project, based on a nihilistic-determinism, but rather a 
game of craps, and Dionysus has always been good with 
dice.  There is the giddy moment when the dice are in the 
air, and then they fall.  To win at such a game one must 
turn risk into a weapon, relinquish the utopian need for 
mastery, and in doing so become a master.  One must 
create a winning throw from the throws of chance and 
cunning of history.  As Artaud said: "There is a risk 
involved, but in the present circumstances, I believe it is 
a risk worth running.  I do not believe we have managed 
to revitalize the world which we live in, and I do not 
believe it is worth the trouble of clinging to; but I do 
propose something to get us out of our maramous, 
instead of continuing to complain about it, and about the 
boredom, inertia, and stupidity of everything.". We 
couldn't agree more.<br><img src=../ONE.GIF width=12 height=3>

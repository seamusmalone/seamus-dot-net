</H1> <H2>a discourse on Cinema and Performance
<P></H2> 
In 1893, projection movies became the latest addition to 
vaudeville, short films projected between live acts.  According 
to Hans Richter, audiences were more fascinated by the virtual 
impossibility of the moving photographs displayed, than with the 
acting or plots of early films, which were thin when present 
(the earliest films were more akin to documentary, a testimony 
to an existence,  more akin to photography's modus 
operandi:"look, see here", than to theatres "let me show 
you". The cinema was based on the verity of the photographic 
(production) rather than the deception (seduction) of theatre.  
But here the verity of film would assure that it would surpass, 
in a few short years, totally eclipse live entertainment, first as 
a lower class (Catholic) entertainment, and later in American 
democratic fashion-- as the media which  was infinitely 
repeatable: the richest and poorest  could and did watch what 
was ostensibly the same movie.<P> 
	It is this democratic element of cinema which I am 
concerned with, its repeatability.  For it is precisely this 
property which makes it Republican, or more precisely, Utopian 
and Platonic.  It is cinematic space wit h which I am concerned, 
or rather its lack of space, its utopian nature, its lack of topos.  
I will eagerly grant that there is much to study in the 
empirical/imperical space of the cinema : the architectural 
phenomenology and social history of movie palaces (all those 
stars!) or of the backlots and locations of historical films.  It is 
I am certain the artificial mediated nature of film which 
guarantees its verity, its truth.  Likewise it is the lack of any 
mediation, the corporeality of live performance which denies it 
any claim to truth... even through method, even when it begins 
to compete with film , to strive toward the "realism" of the 
cinema.  The distinction between the verity of film and the 
falsehood of performance is truly Platonic, incorporating all the 
contradiction of the doctrine of forms.<P> 
	Film is a reifying medium (as it is currently 
understood), it does everything it can to nullify its history, its 
specificity, and above all its mediation:  film is the most direct, 
the most immediate of mediums.  Film does all it can to convince 
the spectator that what is seen is the same, is universal, is 
repeatable.  The verity of film is not only an extension of the 
photographic, its presence as a chemical trace, as a "real" 
representation of life, but it also founded in cinema's 
consumption of the theatre as medium which goes beyond the 
still, whish is capable of movement, of a sort of pseudo life of 
it's own.  But film consumes more than the theatrical, the false,  
if theatre doubles life, mirrors it, cinema consumes it , digests 
it: hence the gastronomy of cinema.  Film only suppresses 
theatre as it consumes it.<P> 
	One must ask, is there a difference between the false 
of the theatre and the false of the theatre and the real of life, 
does the cinema only consume one and the same thing, and if it 
consumes both, it is only more of the same, a second helping, 
for cinema is voracious.  the answer becomes apparent in the 
republican nature of cinema, in Plato's cave which is utopian, no 
place.  In this cave prisoners are chained to their seats and 
forced to watch in the projections of figures on the wall, both 
the other prisoners and bodies which yield the shadows  are 
unable to be seen.  this is of course the situation of the film 
viewer as well.  One becomes still, uncomfortable, yet willing 
to remain in one's seat, both the other viewers and the actors 
are eliminated, all that is left is the eye and the consuming 
virtual image, reality shifts, one is engaged, consumed.  the 
point of the Platonic story is that the images correspond with 
empirical reality and that the outside world (here empirical) 
corresponds to the ideal world of forms, the incorporeal, the 
realm of the mind.  Here the ideal and the form becomes 
inverted, the ideal is given a (literary) body, and the body is 
removed from space, from itself.<P> 
	This is fine enough if you believe it, or if you say it is 
just philosophy.  But to do this is to accept philosophy at face 
value, to internalize philosophy while appearing to take an 
objective critical relation to it . But if one demands of this 
allegory  a relation to history the inquiry yields some  answers, 
in particular those relating to film, it s culinary preferences, 
what it is it likes to consume.  the allegory of the cave is 
Plato's attack on the theatre (Aristophane's having shown him 
for the buffoon he was, perhaps revenge is a better word).  The 
republic is all about political power, power over the polis and  it 
is in doing so a conspicuously overt attack on the theatre.  But 
why, why is it that a plaint for the political control of moral 
idealism should hinge  on the repression of the theatre.  It is 
because idealisms claim to power is dependent on systems of 
representation, a system which is the theatre, live 
performance breaks down.  Platonist idealism must consume, 
moralize tragedy in order for it to set up its reign of judgement.  
But it is precisely because this mode of representation is shaped 
from living bodies, life itself, breaking down the idealists 
investment in the division between the form and content.  What 
is more, Platonism preys on the subtle distinction between life 
and theatre: it it proclaims, "I am no cannibal, I prefer my 
flesh cooked!"<P> 
	What is it that the cinema provides for idealism that 
eve the moralized tragedy, tied to the text, cannot even 
provide?  It is that it completely devours the theatre and by 
devouring it I mean it devours it of life while taking its own 
sustenance from the corpse.  Cinema takes a performance and 
fixes it, take the body and transfers it into a form in which it 
can exactly repeat the same movements again and again.  The 
script, the platonic dialogue did this as well, but only through a 
transformation, the transfer] of one sense for another 
(McLuhan), the eye for the ear, but film does something 
different, plays through a  different set of of mediations, 
representational modes.  Film is a trace, and what is more it 
does not demand the sensual transformation which graphic 
reduction of speech demands.  Cinema is the Platonic medium 
par excellence.<P> 
	How is it that cinema was able to dislodge so easily the 
live performance of vaudeville, it is because ours is a Platonic 
culture, one which has embraced the contradiction known as the 
doctrine of forms, and embrace it in the form of spectacular 
(cinematic if you wish) capitalism.  If film is a medium based in 
repetitions: in means, methods, distribution and technology, it  
is immediately a party to capitalist distribution and technology 
(video of course has taken film a step farther, into everyone's 
livingroom)  exchange based on the universalization of value, 
the repetition of monetary value in diverse situations.  The 
revolutionary potential live performance is here (negatively) 
revealed.  Many have desired to see performance, and in 
particular, to speak from my own historical moment, 
performance art as an un- or less commodifiable means of 
making art than "object making".  This is however a futile 
argument, anyone who has a passing knowledge of Marx should 
realize that all capital is the objectification of an act, not 
exclusively limited to acts of object making.  (One can cite the 
case of the first profession, as a case where the act is central, 
despite arguments which would cast this as a lease on the 
woman's object-body... which would be internal to capitalist 
logic.<P> 
	It is not a question of performance's commodification 
and objectification, (we have seen nothing but its 
commodification and objectification), but its in ability to repeat 
which makes it revolutionary.  This potential has been all but 
ignored even as Artaud has said so clearly, "an expression does 
not have the same voice twice, does not live two lives;  that all 
words, once spoken, are dead and function only at the moment 
when they are uttered, that a form once it has served , cannot 
be used again and asks only to be replaced by another, and that 
the theatre is the only place in the world where a gesture once 
made, can never be made the same way twice.  If the public 
does not frequent our literary masterpieces, it is because those 
masterpieces are literary, that is to say, fixed; and fixed in 
forms that no longer respond to the needs of the time." 
(Artaud)<P> 
	I have no intention to condemn film as a medium, 
although I have rather successfully done so.  Nor is my intention 
here simply laudatory of theatre (I have seen too much really 
really bad theatre and performance art for such universal 
praise).  Nor is to demand a revolutionary performative 
practice (although I do, even if I do not do so here).  The intent 
is simply critical, and if this theoretical criticism informs 
revolutionary practice, well then, all the better.<P> 
	One can conceive of a moment when theatre re-
emerges (for it can never be eliminated, just suppressed: 
witness the necessity of theatre to the most and especially the 
most bourgeois films and television programs (i.e. bad method 
acting, "dramatic lighting", etc).  The theatre can and will (the 
eternal return) return to consume film, the text, all the media 
which have objectified its production.  This has already begun in 
certain literary and cinematic projects.<P> 
	As I have said, the mechanisms of film work to repress 
the specificity of the screening situation, both from the 
subjective and psychological and the external aspects of 
cinematic display.  Through textual and cinematic devices, the 
commercial film sets up an associative relationship to the gaze 
and person of the (male) protagonist and (inferentially to his 
values and desires).  Likewise through physical architectural 
and lighting devices, the sense of viewing space is eliminated, 
as is the social, one's connection to other viewers {Mulvey}  
But my argument in defense of the possibility of a revolutionary 
film practice hinges on the possibility that we do not see the 
same film as one another, and one does not see the same film 
twice, and this knowledge can (and has) been played upon to 
produce a self conscious cinema, a cinema of revolutionary 
potential.<P> 
	On the most base level, one can point to films which 
are edited differently by directors or moral censors for 
different audiences (not to mention the way films are mutilated 
into the two hour Procrustes Bed of television, FCC and 
Commercials).  Beyond this gross level, the differnces in the 
object of the movie, the phenomenon of a screening  is always 
different, the same movie is not ht the same on a VCR in your 
living room, as it is in a theatre in a shopping mall, as it is a 
week later in a discount theatre (for all the darkness, fear of a 
rat crawling over ones feet in search of fallen juju-bees and 
popcorn is not the same experience as mourning a weeks wages 
at the cineplex with 70mm projection and surround sound.). So, 
the material aspects  of the performance situation do not vanish 
just because the lights are off.  But it extends beyond this, 
Birth of a Nation and Gone with the Wind are not the same film 
on both sides of the Mason/Dixon line, even to he  same 
spectator, one carries the whole social and geo-political, dare I 
say psycho-geographical world into the theatre, even if this is 
repressed actively by the film itself.  The poor may feel rich 
watching film (which goes a long way towards revealing its 
popularity, even if this "lease" on the apparent aristocratic 
life style makes them really seven dollars and fifty cents 
poorer), but only through the repression of poverty.  This is 
never the repression of the rich themselves (if they need to 
suppress poverty by rendering it invisible in cinema (as it 
usually is) or happy (in "liberal cinema") that is quite a 
different thing).  Isn't there a whole genre of films recently 
that are about transient wealth? (most of them starring Eddie 
Murphy?).  Lastly, even while a film is a medium of the subject, 
it consumes subjectivity, it never eliminates it.  Male or 
Female, rich or poor, European or Asian, the film is simply 
never, never, the same.<P> 
	This then is the secret of cinema: it is really theatre.  
Each film is different and each copy of "the same film", each 
theatre is different, as is each screening and every seat within 
it, each of your two eyes see a different film and every set of 
eyes carries themselves differently in relation to the film.  Film 
is like all the arts, based on difference, not on similarity, and 
for this reason alone one must say all art is veiled theatre.  
More importantly here it is this theatrical quality, its 
difference, which gives film its revolutionary potential.  The 
particularities of film can be used to play at difference,  Artaud 
says that the Theatre of Cruelty must strive towards exact 
replication in performance in  order to only and necessarily to 
fail: to be obviously different, things must appear the same; 
comparison must be forced through similarity, imagine paying 
keen attention to  the dust on the film as it changes from 
viewing to viewing, even to the total exclusion of the 
"film".<P> 
	In closing, I'd like to return to two moments within the 
nascence of film.  Moments in Vaudeville, where at least for a 
time truth and falsehood, live performance and film coexisted to 
one aim: entertainment.  For I am not concerned with privileging 
and judging, of placing truth over falsehood.  I am more 
concerned with the production of desire and with the creating 
means to make the risk of revolutionary activity joyful, 
exciting and fun.  When they act together they become perhaps 
more revolutionary than they are on their own.  The moments I 
return to are the moments when each of these media are pushed 
rather beyond their conventional limits and become 
indistinguishable on the one hand and break down on the other, 
but work in both cases towards the liberation of desire.<P> 
	As I said at the introduction, films (or at least 
projection films) were first seen entre-act in vaudeville shows.  
In relation to this particular mode of display, the nomadism of 
the vaudeville troupe, an enlightening anomaly occurred.  
Because of Edison's patent strangle hold on the basic cinematic 
apparatus, a number of entrepreneurs started manufacturing 
projectors and cameras in Europe of often eccentric design.  One 
of these pieces of apparatus is notable, taking advantage of  the 
similarity in operation of cameras and projectors (film moving 
in a stutter across a lens at a fixed speed) it was designed to 
perform with minor adjustments as both a camera and a 
projector.  This allowed the projectionists for these troupes to 
take film of the places through which the show traveled, street 
cars, pedestrians, important buildings, landmarks all became 
part of an index of the travels of the troupe, an index more 
over which reversed the city which was being performed for 
into the show to be seen in the next town.  At the time (this was 
given witness to also by the  the combination of camera and 
projector), the camera was fixed, but recorded movement, but 
here for the first time the cinema touched at the root of the 
theatrical, precisely because, even in a fixed frame, it 
reflected its own production,  the subject of these films became 
the projector/cameras movement.  It recorded as an archive its 
own inscription into the history of the socious, its attachment 
to the movement of social groups according to traditional (now 
lost) patterns (Cleveland to Detroit, Detroit to Kalamazoo, 
Kalamazoo to Chicago...).  Here film is an appendage to a social 
structure it is about to distroy, but it is also a great historian, 
the last and most insightful account of these lost moments.<P> 
	The other moment is the films of one Eric Wiess, better 
known as Harry Houdini.  Film was Houdini's downfall.  As 
Vaudeville faded, largely bowing out to the cinema, Houdini 
attempted to transfer his act into this new media so as to 
continue his career and enlarge his fame.  He made several 
films, soon learning that one must in some way guarantee the 
"actual",  the escape tricks that were performed in his films, 
even surrounded as they were by fictional narratives, were 
performed live.  Houdini went so far as to have the guarantee of 
the "actuality' of the stunts printed on the promotional posters.  
It didn't work.  I say these films were Houdini's downfall, for 
anyone could, with a little editing, achieve the same "apparent" 
feats as Houdini, and without risk to life or limb,  moreover, 
they could do even more miraculous and impossible things at 
less expense of time and money.  Here in Houdini's films one 
sees the verity of film breaks down against the mortality of 
flesh and blood.  Film is incapable of taking mortal risk.  
Ultimately there were only two traps from which  Eric Wiess 
was unable to break free, celluloid was one, mortality was the 
other.  Both could be said to be the material implications of the 
body.  But why would Houdini film himself, because of economic 
and egoistic interest to be sure, but perhaps further, it 
represents an extension of his telling obsession with the bodies 
relation to the machine.  Houdini's popularity as a performer 
could be attributed to, at least in part, his staging of what all 
the slaves of industrialization desired, the bodies escape from 
and mastery of the machine.  To an extent then , his films 
proved unsuccessful because they were a contradiction, 
entrapped in the mechanism of film yet appearing (in the 
projection) to escape it.  But rather than failure, I would say 
that Houdini succeeded at something he did not even realize.  He 
proved that something remains and will always remain 
unfilmable.<P> 
	Now, film could not have so easily usurped film had it 
not already been quite dead-- a spectacle devoid of the threat of 
bodily contact and mortal risk.  Radical film with self conscious 
self references has gone farther of late towards actually 
breaking out to the body than the larger portion of performance 
art or theatre.  What I think is important as aesthetic 
practitioners, be we acting as film maker or performance 
artists is to reincorporate the body, to remember it.  This is at 
bottom a performative act, for in no other art is a moving, 
changing body in contact with an audience.  At this moment  of 
re-membering the performative re asserts itself in all the arts, 
taking over from cinema the "written language of reality" for 
at root cinema cannot devour life, it can only devour the 
reflections of life, for life is too big for its mouth and the 
cinematic apparatus is always contained within it.  In the end all 
life, all art is performative, and it only appears otherwise when 
an aspect of life represses it, a repression however, which can 
only take place from within.<P>

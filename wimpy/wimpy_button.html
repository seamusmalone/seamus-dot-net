To enable your wimpy button, you must edit the name/location 
of your mp3 file in two loactions in the HTML code below. 
Both are located within the <OBJECT> tag.
- One is in the <PARAM> tag section. 
- The other is inside the <EMBED tag.

To "point" wimpy to your mp3 file simply add a "?theFile="
plus the location of the mp3 file to the end of the wimpy_button.swf

Here are some examples of how to "point" to an mp3:
wimpy_button.swf?theFile=some_song.mp3
wimpy_button.swf?theFile=mp3_files/some_song.mp3
wimpy_button.swf?theFile=../../mp3_files/some_song.mp3
wimpy_button.swf?theFile=http://www.yourserver.com/mp3_files/some_song.mp3

Here's a confusing issue for you... The wimpy_button.swf uses the HTML 
file that it is embbedded in as the reference point to where the mp3 
file is located. So if for some reason the wimpy_button.swf and the 
HTML file that contains it are located in different/separate directories
(not recommended), keep in mind that you will have to reference 
the mp3 file FROM the HTML file... not the location of the swf file.
Example:
Your HTML file resides here:
http://ywww.yoursite.com/content/html_files/wimpy.html
Your wimpy_button.swf file resides here:
http://ywww.yoursite.com/graphic_files/wimpy_button.swf
And your mp3's reside here:
http://ywww.yoursite.com/mp3_files/some_song.mp3
THEN in the HTML page that the wimpy_button.swf is embedded 
in you would have to refrence the mp3 file FROM the HTML file 
like so:
wimpy_button.swf?../../mp3_files/some_song.mp3
or
You may use an absolute url. 
Example: wimpy_button.swf?theFile=http://www.yourserver.com/mp3_files/example.mp3
NOTE: The wimpy_button and it's associated HTML file must reside on the same server... 
It's a built in security feature of Flash.

If you are putting more than one wimpy button on a page, you should:
1. Use a unique ID in the <OBJECT ... id="uniquename1"> tag
2. Use a unique NAME in the <EMBED ... NAME="uniquename1"> tag

Minimum HTML code:
<object width="550" height="400">
	<param name=movie value="wimpy_button.swf?theFile=example.mp3">
	<param name=bgcolor value=#006666>
	<embed src="wimpy_button.swf?theFile=example.mp3" width="550" height="400" bgcolor=#006666>
	</embed>
</object>

Candyflipping: A Synopsis

<IMG SRC="../graphics/ONE.GIF" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="1" BORDER="0">Candyflipping takes place in the sugar coated urban wasteland that was the underground rave scene of New York in the summer of 1995. Like that city, it is not one text, it is at least several, written on top of each other, interlocking, interweaving, full of complexity, contradiction, and contention. And like the spirit of that scene in its best moments, I have aimed not merely at entertainment, dead stories to fill dead time, but to engaged the active participation of the audience. In the end the reader, like the characters must choose one, or if they can bear it, several, perspectives. 
<BR><IMG SRC="../graphics/ONE.GIF" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="1" BORDER="0"> I can, however, enumerate a few of the books more obvious surfaces. It appears to be a pop culture coming of age novel about a sixteen year old bi-sexual candy raver. It is the story of her friendship with a wheelchair bound DJ from the projects struggling with loss and mourning. It records the seductions of a megalomaniacal promoter preying on the narcissism and needs of others. More playfully it is a science fiction novel in which time, space, nature and technology shift and warp. Or perhaps the warping is merely drug induced paranoia and madness. Taken a bit more seriously, it is a celebration of experience in the last moment the scene was truly underground and at the same time a document of the first in which it was sold out.
<BR><IMG SRC="../graphics/ONE.GIF" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="1" BORDER="0"> It is a book about the flow of power and coercion from the top down into our most intimate relationships, the struggle for love within the vortex of absolute power. It is about the attempts we make to create spaces where we can begin again, to re-invent hope at a moment when the dream of resistance seems to have lost its hold. It is about the difference between the trap of escapism and the power of imagination. It is about the cold fact that freedom and meaning in our lives cannot be achieved alone, that in order to realize our own independence we must recognize the reality, difference and desires of others.
<BR><IMG SRC="../graphics/ONE.GIF" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="1" BORDER="0"> Not despite, but within it's spiraling, the book makes a point and takes a stand. I believe I have written a book of ethics, both to the tell truth about power and bear witness to the dream of freedom. I hope that for its readers, like its characters, Candyflipping ends with a choice. When there is no simple reality, everything rests on choosing a perspective.

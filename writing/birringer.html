Johannes Birringer's book, Theatre, Theory, Post-Modernism in a sense lives up to its title, which is more than most books ever do.  At this time I see serious theoretical study of performance (or post-modern theatre as it is taken up in the title), (something parallel to current film theory) as an important move forward. 
<BR><IMG SRC="../graphics/ONE.GIF" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="1" BORDER="0">This book considers a broad range of topics, not entirely limited to performance, but always from the perspective of performance theory. Birringer draws his speculations from more conventional experimental theatre/performance events like Robert Wilson's Knee Plays and Karen Finley's rants to larger social events like the Los Angeles Olympics, a roadside sculpture installation in Houston, and theorist Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Lyotard's "Les Immateriaux" installation in Paris.  He makes his insights without relying on the modernist discourse of historical development.  For this reason it seems especially important to have Pina Bausch, Heiner M&uuml;ller, Robert Wilson, and Karen Finley contextualized here around Foucault, Barthes, Derrida, and Deleuze instead of (although they're mentioned) Beckett and Ionesco.
<BR><IMG SRC="../graphics/ONE.GIF" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="1" BORDER="0">Birringer's book succeeds in many ways.  It is basically a group of meditations (a word more appropriate here than criticism) on the meanings, contexts, and problems of a number of New Operas, Experimental Theater productions, and Performance events.  Some of these are imbedded in large social/ideological performances which do not appear immediately as artistic productions. His consideration of these Social spectacles succeed where the others do not because the social critique is on the surface, explicit, not implicit or marginalized.
<BR><IMG SRC="../graphics/ONE.GIF" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="1" BORDER="0">This is a book which raises some profound questions, but ultimately refuses to resolve them, or reduce them to their political moment.  Dr. Birringer's political tendencies are everywhere written in small characters between the lines.  I should say I share his tendencies to the best I can reconstruct them from these tiny scribbles, and therefore wish he had written this large.  In essence this resignation of his political tendencies and the explicit political context of the work he deals with reduces these art works to an aesthetics which somehow manages to be social without becoming political.  He ends the book, "I don't  think there are any conclusions I want to draw. But the practices and countermodels I have described allow us to think that the theatre cannot be absorbed by the Spectacle of a technological culture as long as it can still experience and reperform the contradictions produced by this culture. Such performances are the rehearsals for which we are responsible." One is forced to read this as a dissimulation of a very real political project. 
<BR><IMG SRC="../graphics/ONE.GIF" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="1" BORDER="0">Perhaps the most important thing about this book is that it was written. Performance is still a field which gets little serious scholarly consideration or escapes the rubric of "Popular culture". While the book is not all I might hope for, only Herbert Blau has successfully produced theoretical inquiries of performance as a serious artistic movement that surpass what Birringer gives us here. I hope that this book may open dialogue in a community, and represent the beginning of a new consideration of performance outside of art history, anthropology, and theatre, opening a field of Performance Theory which can raise questions and debates with as far reaching insights as has been produced by recent film theory (Mulvey, DeLauretis, etal).  I hope in turn that such study will help or inspire artists develop more theoretically challenging work for this developing audience.

<BR>ah she can count, you can say that of her,
<BR>finger to finger to tounge to fingertip.
<BR>she looks out the window, she only sees
<BR>the reflection of her white light on the glass
<BR>
<BR>and like john rechy's boys, don't fill her
<BR>up, those numbers, just numbers. hope
<BR>she don't catch it, like john rechy's boys
<BR>like the boys she's a number to, pooh face
<BR>(smackin' en em down, those dollar bills,
<BR>one hundred, two hundred.. and I can hear
<BR>those figher planes, you know I can
<BR>almost hear those fucking figher planes)
<BR>
<BR>got the alibies down, knows con games
<BR>and shell games and clue and monopoly. she
<BR>always loses at risk. so she won't play it.
<BR>make money buy property but sense of it all?
<BR>park place, don't land there, the rent is quite dear.
<BR>community pot or private dear, wifey, quiet.
<BR>'let me tell you the reasons i don't write.'
<BR>i have played, i do play, lets keep on playing.
<BR>
<BR>she fucks and she howls just like a demon,
<BR>after you've beaten that annoying white sunshine
<BR>right out. no patience for tantra, for kama sutra
<BR>for it coiled white hot like a filament, it takes one
<BR>to screw in, but two to unscrew it. don't burn
<BR>those wet fingers, it takes hours to cool. don't go
<BR>there, baby, don't go there baby it hurts. it might
<BR>scar, might leave a mark that there is no erasing
<BR>cauterization not pretty, but it will close the wound
<BR>i can see that you know that time of healing,
<BR>see puss on the wound from the shit you rub in it
<BR>imagine that deep and that hot and that searing
<BR>to be known to be seen to be more than reflection
<BR>
<BR>no, she wants red hot, now, red blooded and quick.
<BR>No Ophelia more Hamlet, time? she's done, tick.
<BR>soft red falls on the sidewalk and tummys
<BR>and thighs under Oude Kerk's neon cross,
<BR>you'd traverse those bridges humping canals
<BR>a brown honderd gulden for your favorite abuse
<BR>like old Hitler's dog there's a film of him kicking
<BR>i know love is kicking, so love me. i need it.
<BR>she swallows the darkest part out of storms
<BR>(they're her life) and then says 'not in my tummy'
<BR>but me, i'm all sunshine, you, you're all black
<BR>how much for that game again? it comes cheap, smack
<BR>think in those windows you can buy your hope back?
<BR>conjugate this phrase, you'll use it a lot.
<BR>i have paid, i do pay, i will keep on paying
<BR>
<BR>if she only got paid, you'd know what to call her,
<BR>but she's less of a working girl, more of a client
<BR>she's a bad boy, a frat boy all made up in fluffies.
<BR>she's down in the end zone, but gone wrong direction.
<BR>in on a secret for making the team? it's all about hustle
<BR>and carrying balls, know which side you're playing on.
<BR>fill her up with your beer, fill her up with your football
<BR>shoot pool, or clay pidgeons, or do laundry together
<BR>pick your shorts from your ass crack while hair
<BR>sprouts from your ears, don't forget the romance!
<BR>tell her why your tooth's missing, tales of 360's
<BR>how human, see the philosophy, poetry, politics...
<BR>in a loose wheel or hammering your nuts on the rail
<BR>
<BR>knows her type, knows her typing, sees them
<BR>coming and going, know with her eyes closed,
<BR>best way to know'em! i know that for sure.
<BR>close your ears, close your mind, your carport, your lips
<BR>don't move your emotions, babe, just move your hips
<BR>can she type? she can type, she can type slowly.
<BR>ah there's nothing to it once again, this once and always,
<BR>there 'aint nothing to it. sit still, don't do a thing
<BR>but then again that's what they pay her for.
<BR>she's paid not to go nowhere, she's not paid to move
<BR>
<BR>she's worked it all out, she's a hot calculator,
<BR>you can see in her eyes how she's done the math
<BR>she knows the exchange rate and her trade in value
<BR>the boys all say what mathmatical eyes she's got.
<BR>they stare deep into 'em and see they see the numbers
<BR>oh my god, i'm in love, it looks like my team jersey.
<BR>(which she could fill out better, but she's got a hot ass)
<BR>that's what they're thinking those wingmen those legmen
<BR>but the breast men won't have her. oh well, their loss.
<BR>you're not responsible if you let her make the pass.
<BR>and the locker room boys draft her for their team
<BR>to build out the portals for their new war machine.
<BR>
<BR>she may not make art, but she's made herself miserable
<BR>lucky for her, this year misery sells.
<BR>and the music that's in her, will it ever come out.
<BR>are they embarassing sounds, sunshine. naw
<BR>she's got all the products to take the place of art.
<BR>
<BR>you're playing at risk, sweetie, like it or not
<BR>move armys, sweep continents, roll the dice roll the dice
<BR>
<BR>you know what those sports are a metaphor for,
<BR>penetration, bomb pass, and slaps on the ass.
<BR>you know they can't wait to pile up on the grass
<BR>just what we're lookin' for, got the skills, got the pretty
<BR>bend over darlin' while while we get our cock shitty.
<BR>maybe one by one, but she'll take on the whole crew
<BR>she might know her numbers, but  she's prolly lost count
<BR>how this for a cop out? 'i'm thowing about'
<BR>
<BR>she's a slave and she knows it, i like that.
<BR>but she loves the leash, and the cuffs and the jailor
<BR>un-re-quited love of the whore for the sailor,
<BR>he's gone away, matey, pal, buddy, friend,
<BR>'if  I cry hard enough will he kick me again?'
<BR>she wants what she don't want and don't
<BR>want what she wants. coldest of all, she is
<BR>what she hates. he's not using me silly, i'm
<BR>the one using him. the widow reflection is kind
<BR>to her, sunshiney face. you are right about one
<BR>thing, he will never leave you  if you become him
<BR>she's split right down the middle picasso's girl
<BR>in the mirror, a caryatid, or maybe more like it,
<BR>she's carrivagio's boy, himself as young bacchus.
<BR>
<BR>Even checked it with the higher-ups, right
<BR>to the directors. back to work, back to tv
<BR>and those more carnal distractions
<BR>it all comes too costly, those numbers again.
<BR>she is bought, she is sold, she is spent
<BR>whatever the case she's no budget for love.

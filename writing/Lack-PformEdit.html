<BLOCKQUOTE>The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of men, is a demand for their 
real happiness.  The call to abandon their illusions about their condition is a call to 
abandon a condition which requires illusions.
<br>- Marx, Introduction to a Critique of 
Hegel's Philosophy of the Right</BLOCKQUOTE>

Our society is not lacking Shamen, but rather Shaman in this society are lacking.  On the one hand Neo-
Shamanism can be traced to narcissistic desires for omniscience and omnipotence, and therefore a return to an 
infantile relation to the world, in short, it is a neurotic mode of art making.  Further, it is based on a false set 
of presumptions regarding the efficacy of personal transformation and "symbolic" action.  It provides an outlet 
for the desire for social transformation which is entirely safe, a mere simulation of opposition.  In fact one 
finds the spiritualism and idealism of ritual performance to have common ground with the social institutions 
they supposedly attempt to overthrow.  What's worse, by reasserting an idealist world view as tied to the 
nature of the cosmos, it makes the operations of capitalism appear dangerously "natural."
Neo-shamanism is a negation of the problems of industrial production by turning not to a better future, 
but an imaginary construction of a better past, or the bliss of the noble savage of other cultures, a golden age 
in which nature provided bountifully for all, which is in this dream, retrievable simply by dropping our tools 
and returning to the land.  It's answers to the social, political, and aesthetic problems of our post-modern 
moment is a retreat to another life, but not any lived life, but rather one constructed from nostalgia, which in 
our age is a nostalgia for the sure footed epistemology of bygone eras, a retreat not to nature, as if nature ever 
existed, but to a Field Museum diorama, to a modernist conception of the primitive, a flattened past which is 
not lived but viewed.<P>
Much of the ritual performance I have seen has had a political agenda attached to it.  I still believe, more 
strongly than ever, that art should not attempt to seal itself off from politics, so at least in this aspect, I have 
respect for the efforts of Neo-Shamanistic artists.  I see Pseudo-Shaman practice however as an ill advised 
homeopathic cure.  Ultimately they reproduce the alienation they seek to overcome.  Suzi Gablik seems to 
suggests that this neo-shamanism is another manifestation of the artist escaping the studio, and thus a move 
towards greater social/political efficacy, but where does the artist escape the studio to? To the primeval 
forests or to the streets of the contemporary city? Gablik, unable to see the historical developments which 
have lead to the the city as the site of the modern struggle, would rather wash her hands of it and return to the 
forest.  This may ultimately be the central issue in regards to performance, a movement founded on the idea of 
the artist escaping the confines of the studio, the gallery, the museum in order to make life more immediately the 
basis for the production of art.  Where do we escape to, the Tutonic forest mythically beyond the historical 
struggles of class or to the streets of the city.<P>

<H3>The Narcissistic Omnipotence as a result of Political and Economic 
Disempowerment</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"I can't bear the thought of being freed by anyone but myself"1</BLOCKQUOTE>
Belief is based on, and has its function in relation to, the means of production.  Shamanism and the 
mythic mind set can be seen to be tied to agrarian modes of production, hunting and gathering, and animal 
herding.  The relation to and position of nature in relation to culture is quite different than in the industrial 
era.  As such, I do not believe the emergence of Shamanic Performance in this post-industrial culture is a 
historical extension of practical shamanism, but rather it functions as the de-historicization of these practices 
which degrades the history of peoples by idealizing their own historical position and level of technology.  On 
the other hand (more important for me for I have to live with it), the de-historicization of the practice of art in 
our time and a move away from the possibility of collective meaningful action.  If we allow for the evaluation 
of cultures on their own terms, we must demand the analysis of our own culture to be true to the time and 
place particular to it.  Todays performance artist as Shaman responds to very different needs in contemporary 
culture than did the shaman as healer in a society without science, medicine and electronics.<P>
Analyzing this "reinvention of shamanic form" in its historical context, not as an expression of a trans-
historical practice of an abstract "natural man", but as the outgrowth of purely contemporary concerns, one 
sees that the beliefs and actions of neo-shamanistic performers complies very closely with Freud's description 
of the Narcissistic/Omnipotent stage of child development. It is important to distinguish this infantile 
narcissism from vanity.  It is a reaction to an overwhelming world in which one feels powerless. When an 
infant finally produces or discovers the boundaries of its self, the infant finds itself with no power to control 
its circumstances.  In reaction, the infant attempts to return to the undifferentiated moment, but this time to 
retrieve power over the other which was so shortly perceived as part of the self.  The infant imagines itself as 
actually in control of everything accompanied by the belief that everything is part of the self.
<P>But why do we find performance artists returning to this moment?  Capitalist society creates infantile 
individuals, in order to reproduce its own mode of production.  So the construction of an imaginary 
omnipotence embedded in infantile relations is not altogether beyond understanding.  One finds the reasons 
for the construction of an imaginary omnipotence both in the larger social formations of capital, the sense in 
which it creates feelings of social alienation.  Then again, in the related phenomenon by which the individual 
feels ineffectual to change the conditions which have caused this alienation for the very fact that they are 
alienated.  Capitalism, by its very nature is alienating and disempowering.  To the extent that money is power, 
and the worker is economically exploited (paid less than his labor is worth), his power is systematically 
removed from him.<P>
In the face of the individual's position in society, one feels unable to function to effect change.  One 
desires to change one's position, and to transform society, but is unable to do so alone.  One may lack the 
relation to a group large enough to make these changes collectively.  At the same time, even when in a group 
large enough to make such changes, say a political party, one feels unable to have a meaningful impact on 
decisions made within the group itself.<P>  
Neo-shamanism seems to fulfill this need for relation to some larger group. It  is a claim of membership to 
the largest possible group, "I am at one with all," while placing oneself in absolute control of this group, at its 
center "I have the godhead within me."  With the lack of real power to change, because collective problems 
demand collective solutions, we find the Pseudo-Shaman presuming superhuman-supernatural power (as well 
as a privileged insight and relationship with nature to justify it) in order to solve these problems alone.  This 
is done without engaging others, and in doing so buttresses the embattled feelings of personal power, 
importance, and efficacy.   What the neo-shaman is left with is truly an absolute belonging, the need to matter 
and belong to everyone, but as such it is a resignation from all the contingent, frustrating, partial, and 
disappointing belongings of everyday life.  By returning to an immediate and internally constructed 
community one does not have to risk rejection, or conflict of need with others, one does not allow for 
difference.  By assuming a spiritual connection with others, we deny them the right to have difference, to be 
other than ourselves, or more succinctly, to be different than our projections of them.  Further, this is 
personally impoverishing, as  one does not allow these contingencies, and the conflicting views and desires of 
others to bring learning or change in oneself by allowing the other to be outside of one's mind.  One privileges 
an imagined inner communication, a projection of the other which eclipses lived social relations, removing the 
pain and loss of these relations along with the joy and pleasure.<P>
Pseudo-Shamanism valorizes traumatized individuals, relieving them of dealing with the real social 
origin of their trauma, and by validating them as shamen, in essence giving them license to forego mere 
corporeal and collective answers to these issues in favor of personal, spiritual and otherworldly answers.  
These feelings of narcissistic omnipotence in turn allow for the development of a theory of symbolic efficacy.  
If the narcissistic mind set allows one to posit a shared unconscious, then symbolic acts of self transformation 
can be seen to have a universal impact.  But such a position is on the one hand an idealism, which is very close 
to the mind set of Capitalism itself, and on the other an entirely safe way for Capital to allow for the illusion 
of opposition, while guaranteeing it is not effective.<P>  

<H3>Signification, Idealism, and the efficacy of Signs in Shamanism and its 
complicity with Capitalism
</H3>Neo-Shamanism generally defends itself through an argument that all life is interconnected and 
interdependent, therefore social change can be effected at an individual level.  The transmission of this change 
in consciousness will be carried throughout the collective mind.  Such transmissions take place, at least 
within rituals, in both neo- and practicing  shamanism through symbols.  In doing so it relies on the symbolic. 
Moreover, it is a static symbolic order where history is given meaning from the signs, the signs do not take on 
meaning in history.   This faith demands an investment into signification which is truly dangerous.  Not only 
does such belief in the efficacy of symbolic action reinforce narcissism, but the supposedly static nature of the 
signs are quickly used to legitimate any given interpretation, even those that are reprehensible.  These static 
myths also serve to make resistance (implying the possibility to change) impossible, even while historical 
change is taking place.  
An instance of this faith in the symbolic could be seen when Joseph Beuys locked himself in Ren&eacute; Block 
gallery in New York with a coyote. He believed that he had "made contact with the  psychological trauma 
point of the United States' energy constellation." The coyote had come not only to stand for, but to "be" 
America.  This faith can be seen again when Suzi Gablik describes Fern Shaffer and Othello Anderson's 
photo-rituals she plays slight of hand, in a sentence- she becomes the mother goddess, she no longer merely 
represent her.  Such a shift is a very fundamental faith in representation, the equation "being=representing" 
without consideration of the material or historical conditions under which the representations occur, she 
doesn't take into account the historically modern process of photography which is apparently central to this 
work, or how the photographic representations (much less the toxic photo chemicals) relate to the re-
presentation of the ritual.2
<P>It is worse when the symbolic entirely eclipses effective action. Purifying the Rio Grande with a thimble, 
as one of  Gablik's heros undertook, only provides alibis for not getting involved in a community petition 
against the plants dumping their waste into the river,  for increasing regulation or enforcement of regulation, 
or better yet actually overturning the system of economic power and subjugation of which such pollution is 
only one of numerous symptoms.  This reliance on the symbolic as means to transformation reinforces a 
divisive disjuncture of symbolic action and practical action.  This disjunction has proven important in the 
past to capital.  The freedom of speech clauses (with their various abridgements) are the perfect means to 
provide an outlet for oppositional forces; at the same time the system uses this release as a guarantee of truly 
open and democratic space as a means to stop others from resisting.<P>  
This construction of the unconscious may appear to demand a collective, but as already noted, it is 
really based on a belief in self sufficiency and faith in the rugged individual for whom the collective is better 
left imagined.  Such a construction of the individual reminds me of  the ad in which the Indian cries on the side 
of a freeway as someone throws a gum wrapper or a cigarette out the window of a passing car.  It places the 
responsibility for pollution on the individual, not on corporations who have overpackaged the gum, or any 
on other larger social groups for not developing effective mass transportation, or demanding stronger 
pollution control from the manufacturers.  It is a little known, but well documented fact that the corporations 
which got a tax write off for public service for producing this spot are among the nation's worst corporate 
industrial polluters, and well over half of pollution is industrial in origin.  Considering that all the polluting 
agents are mass produced, and hard sold to a public alienated by their economic position, we can safely trace 
all pollution back to the corporate boardroom.<P>
Further, such a position in which symbolic action has material efficacy is pinned to the same idealist 
metaphysics (often veiled in an interpretation of  Eastern tradition, which I find equally suspicious) which is 
essentially the same as the metaphysical propositions necessary for Capital, and in particular the law of 
value to operate.  It is exactly such a denomination of things to signs which allows objects to be exchanged in 
a system defined by the abstract sign of their monetary value.  Strangely enough, despite the equally misguided 
cries to abandon the materialist greed of Capitalism (in part recapitulated in the asceticism which often 
attends pseudo-shamanic spirituality), Capitalism itself operates, has always operated on the basis of a 
system of signification. That is, the reduction of everything to the code of money, a sign to which all else is 
reduced, everything can be bought and sold.   Marx notes in the Grundrisse, "Capital takes on an immaterial 
quality precisely because Capitalism is the social relations and not the objects themselves." Both Marx and 
Debord note that Capitalism is the materialization of idealist philosophy and Christian other-worldly 
values, "Philosophy, the power of separate thought and the thought of separate power, could never by itself 
supersede theology.  The spectacle is the material reconstruction of the religious illusion.  Spectacular 
technology has not dispelled the religious clouds where men placed their own powers detached from 
themselves; it had only tied them to an earthly base. "3  It is for this reason more than any other, neo-
shamanism's investments in reproducing the subject and ideology necessary to perpetuate Capital,  that I am 
opposed to the re-emergence of "shamanism."  Neo-Shamanism not only fails to resist the alienation of 
capitalism, but in fact only reinforces it.

The Mythic world view Fatalism and the Naturalization of History: The function this 
serves in capital- naturalization/reification- the Myth of the primitive and the return to Eden 
Third world colonialism and the cultural colonialism and MNC's
Such a faith in the symbolic is often tied to, as Neo-Shamanism is, the reconstruction of a mythic world 
view.   However such a world view is not benign:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"Within myth, the passage of time takes the form of predetermination.   The 
course of events is said to be predestined by the gods, written in the stars, spoken by 
the oracles, or inscribed in sacred texts.   Strictly speaking, myth and history are 
incompatible.   The former dictates that because human beings are powerless to 
interfere in the workings of fate, nothing truly new can happen, while the concept of 
history implies the possibility of human influence upon events, an history with it, the 
moral and political responsibility of people as conscious agents to shape their own 
destiny.
"Myths give answers to why the world is as it is when an empirical cause and 
effect cannot be seen, or when it cannot be remembered.  Although they satisfy the 
desire felt by being for a meaning-filled world, it is at the high price of turning that 
world back upon them as inescapable fate."4</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

We find that what is available here is a means to escape the responsibility for change.  If it is natural 
that things recirculate and stay the same, then it is also true that nothing we do can change them.  We can rest 
assured then that we are incapable of resisting the very real changes that capital inflicts upon us, for the fact 
that it too is only part of the natural process.  The myth of progress not only naturalizes unchecked capitalist 
development in the West, but also our right to "manifest destiny."  Our societies' construction of a natural 
need to survive is of course ideological, and functions to keep us from asking under what circumstances is life 
worth living, as anything which is natural is beyond change and therefore beyond question.  This natural 
need to survive also is commonly used as a means to justify the existence of class and the violence necessary to 
hold classes in place under the general rubric of "Social Darwinism."  In short Capital justifies its excesses 
through its own naturalization, survival of the fittest.<P>
Ritual performance seems to search for its solutions in the past, but not in history, rather in a mythical 
construction of the past designed as it were to tautologically support its own claims.  The belief that the myths 
are eternal forms only serve to hide that they always change in relation to the needs of power.  Bourgeois 
reconstructions of history and the primitive have certainly aided them in their domination of class and culture 
alike.   Nietzsche found a similar construction of the "primitive" in the Wagnerian Opera, an art form which 
probably in truth shares more with these pseudo-shamen than any healing rituals they claim as precedent.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"...they could abandon themselves to the dream of having descended once more 
into the paradisiacal beginnings of mankind&hellip; Here we can see into the innermost 
development of this thoroughly modern variety of art, the opera: art here responds to 
a powerful need, but it is a non-aesthetic need: the yearning for the idyllic, the faith in 
the primordial existence of the artistic and good man."5</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
Opera is not the reconstruction of tragedy but the reconstruction of history for the fulfillment of purely 
contemporary needs, and in todays' society as in Nietzsche's, the "past" serves as a basis to legitimate a flee 
from the responsibility for the production of the present.  Such a need to escape modernity in its entirety, 
forsaking the good along with the bad, this position again repeats the infantile tendency to see things only in 
absolute terms.  Not only does it see the present as all bad, but it also idealizes the past.<P>
I should emphasize that the retreat from the oppression of urban life is not viable for the masses of 
people.  We no longer have the option of a collective retreat to the woods.  We may find there are more humane 
ways of organizing our living and working space for the sake of our own sanity, if not for the maintenance of 
our environment, but communal life in the forest is not a solution except for the few that can afford to leave 
their jobs, and the pleasures of modern existence.  The industrial revolution, like the shift from hunting and 
gathering to agrarian life before it, was brought on by the inability of the land to provide.  One look at 
Somalia or Ethiopia several years ago, in contrast to Southern California reveals the difference between long 
droughts in developed and under-developed countries.  Unless one wants to mythologize and &aelig;stheticize the 
pain of starvation, I would prefer to be in L.A.  smog, insurrections, and all.<P>
Demands to remove the ugliness of industrial production are generally responded to by removing them 
from our sight; this is the meaning of "post" in post industrial.  We can move the auto-plants to Mexico, `we 
can live in the suburbs,' we can try to regain a pastoral life on the land.   All of these amount to a rejection of 
the same thing, a rejection of something (or seeing something) which demands transformation.  A rejection of 
responsibility and a rejection of all the possibilities for the realization of human desires in a retreat to 
fulfilling needs, most dangerous of all, personal needs, needs which also reject their social and ideological 
origins.<P>
There is a colonialist attitude in Neo-Shamanism as well, to go elsewhere is to go back in time.  By 
escaping the polis these artists hope to escape the whole of modernity, but modernity is not only an external 
construction, but an ideology which shaped these subjects themselves.  They cannot but colonize the natural 
world with their own modernist view of it.   Perhaps more importantly, it creates a benign apolitical map of 
the world, one which covers the more insidious map of the post-modern. This hidden map would show the 
actual power relations between developed and undeveloped countries, along with the attendant flow of 
goods, resources, and exploitation of labor based on this mapping.<P>

<H3>Conclusion</H3>
I think the need of these Pseudo- Shamen to have a positive impact is well founded; that is below the 
level of lack there is a real desire, a desire for political efficacy and worth in an actual community (even if 
this community is alienated and therefore on some level only imagined).  The mystification of real social 
power has to an extent lead some to the false conclusion that real power is only accessible through a more 
"real" mysticism.  Our post-modern society, as a direct outgrowth of the industrial alienation and its further 
mediation in the spectacle has undermined the classical model of cultural authority.<P>
Furthermore, many of these rituals appear as a retreat from the "modern" world.  Indeed, one should, I 
believe, have a critical position in relation to the despotic destruction of an economy which produces and 
consumes for its own sake without regard to quality of life or environmental damage, leading ultimately to the 
foreshortening of this planets viability.  But one cannot abstract the problem or the solution from the social 
and historical forces which have brought about this crisis.  On the one hand, urban life is the result of social 
developments which came out of real improvements in living; medicine and technologies which allow people to 
live longer in more comfort, resulting in a population boom,.  Ironically, the systems of power which attended 
this growth, in terms of organized, more efficient production, in short Capitalism, have become a means to 
enslave humanity.  One finds these gains reduced to an extended and more comfortable slavery.
We are all interconnected, we are all dependent on the same resources of the same planet, but these 
connections are material and historical.  When one denies the material and historical nature of these 
connections, in the ideology of spiritual connection, one has consigned oneself to complicity with ones 
oppressors.  We must work together for change, with our bodies and our minds, not with our minds outside 
our bodies.   The struggle today, and it is a struggle, is to re-invest our bodies, our corporeal action with 
meaning.<P>
The repressive aspects of Capitalist production are held in place on the one hand by an ideological 
system, which can be addressed and manipulated by symbols.  But when the belief system which attends 
power is in real crisis, you better believe that the material force of oppression will come into play.  If you sit 
down in the middle of any large city's street and present yourself in protest to the oppression of the city, you 
will be dragged as roughly as possible by police out of that street.  They prefer pulling you by the hair or by 
the collar (to choke you) if they have the opportunity and they will put your handcuffs on too tight so your 
hands swell up and get numb.  No amount of prayer or meditation will stop this.  Multi-national 
Corporations are not afraid of Mantras and they will do nothing to increase job safety of the quality of life of 
their Third World employees because you chant and dance naked in the woods.  They will not stop dumping 
toxic chemicals into lakes, will not of their own accord spend money on double hulled oil tankers, if you 
chant on the beach in costume, even if you become the Mother Goddess.  People have been involved in Pseudo-
Shamanism for the last twenty years and to my knowledge I have never known one oil spill to dissipate, one 
square inch of earth to be "healed," one landfill to vanish.  In fact the situation has gotten worse.  I believe 
that these companies love the Mantras, the prayer beads, the tarot decks.  Not only do they make millions if 
not hundreds of millions of dollars off the New Age Industry, they know that you are safely invoking spirits 
instead of organizing for meaningful political action.  I would say Marx perhaps said it best, most succinctly, 
in the Paris Manuscripts "religion is the opiate of the people", had Nietzsche not outdone him in Thus Spoke 
Zarathustra, "I entreat you brothers, remain true to the earth, and do not believe those who speak to you of 
superterrestrial hopes!  They are poisoners, whether they know it or not."<P>

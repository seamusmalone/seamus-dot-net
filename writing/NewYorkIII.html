If you are not fluent in a language until you dream in it,<BR>
what does it mean that Manhatten has become<BR>
the topography of my Unconscious?<P>

Not the same city I walked for months<BR>
down Avenue of the Americas from<BR>
the Vanderbilt Y, with its icy showers and gritty carpets <BR>
on the islands East shoulder sloping down to the United Nations,<BR>
and cement benches demanding, in chill spray paint<BR>
U.S. out of South Africa and El Slavador<BR>
to Washington Square, where chip-tooth fags <BR>
wearing stirrup pants and Kieth Harring T-Shirts<BR>
sell antiques and dirty postcards<BR>
and to Vennessa's father's loft on West Broadway and Broome<BR>
a dentist, who throws dinner parties<BR> 
where dancers and art dealers comment on the virtuosity of<BR>
a handsome skinny Jamaican who sings and plays a grand piano<BR>
lost in the bright yellow hardwood I think must have been a gymnasium<BR>
as we look on from the balcony<P> 

And Charles Roberts, now dead, you were with me<BR>
and shared my desire for European remix 12"s<BR>
some fragments of this place to take back to Michigan<BR>
as if freedom could be held in the grooves of vinyl<BR> 
or as static potential on magnetic tape<P>

In this room at the YMCA that we shared with two other boys<BR>
we all stayed up to watched Interludes After Midnight,<BR> 
a nude talk show interupted only by escort service info-mercials, <BR>
women spreading their vaginas with gynecological equiptment<BR>
at the suggestion of the gravelly voiced black host, well hung<BR>
not one us having the bravery to jack off<BR> 
even though all hid our pajamas tight with hard ons under the blankets<BR>
I at least would wait for the cold morning showers in the hall<BR>
In which we were warned lurked lusty homosexuals<BR>
and from which we returned with carpet grit clinging to our damp feet <P>

I rewalked those streets and strayed into the New York of my imagination<BR>
in my dreams of Seventeen, those months after my father's body<BR>
was returned to the family reduced to silky grey ash and chalky ground grit<P>

Today New York is a city of carnivores without enough meat<BR>
everywhere gristle and bone, one must learn to share the pleasure <BR>
of the Chinese entrepreneurs on Lafayette below Canal<BR>
who gnaw endlessly on the joints of Chicken feet,<BR>
no hope of swallowing or cracking the thin bones for marrow<P>

Today in this city bicycle frames are left to hang from their locks<BR>
without wheels or handle bars or seat<BR>
And the city has pulled the tendons away from my knee<BR>
as I cross the width of the island at 42nd street from Ad agency to temp agency <BR>
in search of typesetting work, I stop to look at music but now I buy CD's<P>

Grand Central is still the same Grand Central, <BR>
where we arrived in our airport bus from Newark<BR>
Times Square is still Times Square walkmen filled windows,<BR>
silk tie shops, quarter peep shows and the giant Coca-Cola sign<BR>
only new is Rush Limgaugh's face high up with Fuji Film in neon<P>

I think again that you Charles Roberts are not alive to walk with me<BR>
in this city where the buddy system was strictly enforced<BR>
where we left the others for the used recordshops of Greenwich Village<BR>
where we were offered drugs by dirty Rastifarians.<BR>
paniced and took a cab back uptown<BR>
Where you betrayed me and refused to pay up like the others when,<BR>
after I had spent my food money on tapes<BR> 
I accepted a bet to enter a topless bar<P>

As I walk through Central Park past the children's Zoo toward<BR>
the MoMA where I will see again this afternoon<BR>
Des Moiselle D'Avignon and certain works of Salvador Dali<BR>
and wonder where exactly my friends used to jump the fence after hours <BR>
and give their boyfriends blowjobs and lay naked on the summer grass<BR>
We would no longer be virgins if they still played the Rocky Horror Picture Show <P>

I will spend days on sheets, a little stiff with sweat and cum<BR>
rising only for ginger ale and icecream sandwiches<BR> 
I hobble on my swollen knee across the street to the bodega<BR>
where the fat clerk shuffles to salsa as he fills my bag and takes my money<P>

Is there any flesh left in this city or must I learn to endlessly gnaw<BR>
on joints grown cold and hard like chewing gum in your mouth too long<BR>
In the mornings do not trucks filled with meats restock the markets of New York<BR>
do they not fill the tunnels and the bridges with their girth <BR>
surely the slaughter houses of New Jersey and Pensylvania have no lack of business<BR>
unload the beef, unload the lard and lamb<BR>
Was this not once a city of Delis? Now it seems a city of convenice store buffets<BR>
cheap sushi and greasy sweet and sour hung in metal bins above steaming water.<BR>
I remember two fisted sandwiches from a shop near Rockefeller Center<BR>
I cannot seem to find it on my lunch hour<BR>
I remember turkey soup in China town that filled my bowl with half a breast<BR>
I cannot seem to find it after seminar<P>

Now it seems hard to find a Puerto Rican cafe on the lower East Side<BR>
where I can afford to eat Rice and Recaito,<BR>
and choke up the chiken for the gristle<BR>
perhaps I will eat Vietnamese from now on<P>

Carrying home my bike frame slung over my shoulder<BR>
It reminds me of the carcass of a turkey the day after Thanksgiving<BR>
through the wet peace of Driggs Avenue's slope and curve<BR> 
the illuminated Empire State is a triangle over Segnor McGorlick Park<P>

I wonder if this is a city of the living or the dead<BR>
This East River is as corrupted as any Styx<BR>
any of these bicycle thief- junkies on the Williamsburg Bridge<BR>
could be my Charon, into what hand to place the coin?<P>

Instead of buried under the desert of Arizona,<BR>
with a tumor on the stem of your brain<BR>
that brought you merciful death some Friday morning in early September<BR>
like Alan Ginsburg's mother I will hope to find you Chuck Roberts<BR>
some Sunday morning after brunch picking over Orchard Street Market,<BR>
alive and happy, living with a woman who contents you<BR>
who amuses you and makes you think,<BR> 
Maybe you're teaching at the New School<BR>
Maybe at the Knitting Factory you now and then play music<P>

Maybe my knee has gone bad because I carry your weight as I walk these streets<BR>
If New York is a city of the dead should I admit my residency,<BR>
would it help me to claim the status of tourist if I should I visit the statue or Ellis Island?<BR>
I think I must decide if I am staying here, <BR>
where the fat has been picked from my ribs while I ams still alive<BR>
Even with a nuance, a history still buried below the cobbles and asphalt<BR>
How can I deny that my mind has in those grey autumn days asleep in Greenpoint<BR>
awkwardly begun to speak the language of these unfamiliar streets<BR>
where for the first time people comment on my accent<P>

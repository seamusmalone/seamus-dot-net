America, I have no way to measure time<br>
I will be gone in seconds<br>
I am dull to your seasons<br>
Winter passes without chilling me<br>
Summer passes without darkening my skin<p>
<P>
Ghosts of the twentieth century <br>
What do you have in your hands?<br>
Guns from Israel?<br>
Stolen Radios?<br>
Shopping carts of Aluminum I have left for you?
<P>
Let me warn you of a danger:<br>
Do not dream, I beg you,<br>
leave your dirty tongue dry-<br>
leave your tongue wheat pasted to the roof of your mouth<br>
be silent
<P>
Farmers of America, <br>
Let me invoke images of the Great Depression:<br>
Milk will run on America's back roads,<br>
milk will run again into the gravel.<br>
America, your wheat bins will be overturned<br>
your harvest will be charred
<P>
What meat will I eat in my time?<br>
only what is left in the sun to rot<br>
I am but seconds, I am a maggot, a blind intestine<br>
From Larva to Pupa to green blooded Bug,<br> 
I will live for a day and no more<br>
time is best measured in seconds,<br> 
and I bring with me ten thousands deaths<br>
like mosquito husks drawn to the flame<br>
to collect with the wax below the candle stick
<P>
Tractors as big as the great baleen whales,<br>
pyramids of yellow and tires,<br>
devouring the golden sea of wheat and soy<br>
America who owns your great chest and belly?<br>
Name the corporations so I may speculate on futures.
<P>
America do not dream of agricultural gods, of fertility.<br>
Do not dream America, do not dream America.<br>
I refuse to dream because even my closed eyes<br>
offer only images of mirrored insurance company towers<br>
reflecting city lights and sky
<P>
Do not dream America,<br>
do not let your eyes twitch in sleep.<br>
Vague ghosts of the twentieth century,<br>
Arms laden- doped and contented<br>
what game is broadcast tonight?<br>
what brand of beer will sour your stomach?<br>
what brand of beer will sit in your throat and burn?
<P>
Perhaps I can hear a redemptive belch of the proletariat <br>
over the choral hum, the slow songs<br> 
from the hymnal pages of Architectural Digest<br>
window treatments, Corian, and brass fixtures<br>
The Holy Family has gathered for Vespers.
<P>
Mother, if you sing with this choir of butchers, I cannot indict you<br>
for you have made me a choir boy and a butchers apprentice,<br>
listen to me enumerate the tenderest cuts
<P>
Holy Mother, indeed, your home is beyond reproach,<br>
your great enamel basins are washed-<br>
I am blinded by soap, my mouth is slick and stinging with lye.<br>
indeed, your carpets are softer than my bed-<br>
softer than the bed of millions-<br>
I want to sleep on your carpets, millions seek rest upon your carpets.
<P>
While you are dreaming of turquoise and emerald<br>
the endless offerings of the Home Shopping Channel,<br>
I am awake in the dark hours of morning<br>
and Mother, your house is infested with field mice,<br>
they eat your crackers and your bread.<br>
I wait until three AM, and the ghosts come<br>
their faces haunt the television, begging compassion,<br>
did you know for only dollars a month I can do so much<br>
feed the starving of Uganda and Brazil,<br>
thirty thousand face that will not cry for milk tomorrow.<br>
surely, bearing the guilt of watching must grant me some reprieve?
<P>
Holy Mother, Eden is receding.<br>
I once was a pin cushion for your lies<br>
I will no longer clean your foul gutters or spray down your facade<br>
I will not rehearse romance on your piano<br>
I will not dream of your milk or your rocking chair<br>
I will not dream of you in your absence<br>
I will eat the apple to the core and be done.
<P>
I want to take a thousand bodies into my grave.<br>
If I cannot swim in the flesh of dreams<br>
I demand at least kisses in my sleep<br>
another's warm tongue in the dry cavity of my face<br>
deep kisses and no dreams, no tenderness
<P>
If I take a lover do not disturb my bed-<br>
leave the stains in my sheets,<br>
leave the grease on my pillow<br>
when passion is gone from my bed<br> 
this will remain my only proof that I have had a body.
<P>
Already proof is fading,<br>
no soreness in my thighs, no pinching of my shoes is enough<br>
my eyes are burning, my intestines are burning,<br>
my breath is slow and troubled<br>
I need no one to bathe me and I will not bathe myself
<P>
America, let us make a contract,<br>
I will not dream if you do not dream<br>
and if I forget myself for a moment<br>
do not call me back too quickly<br>
let me have my few seconds to remain nameless<br>
to escape the tyranny of my own image.
<P>
If I lay with naked men, <br>
finished cocks curled like necks of sleeping wood ducks<br>
against the dark hair of their inner thighs<br>
do not speak to me.<br>
If I lay with naked women,<br>
curled hair matted and sticky, blood flush labia pouting<br>
wet across the crease of small buttocks-<br>
do not speak to me.<br>
Is it I who Has broken these necks,<br>
have I made these wounds bleed?<P>

I will pass quickly- let me go<br>
I will be only seconds upon your maps<br>
carry on with commerce,<br>
exchange if you must, do business, trade<br>
just do not ring my phone,<br>
leave me to lay still with my comrades,<br>
we are not organizing, we are not conspiring<br>
We can no longer hope for more than dreamless sleep.<P>

I will not dream if you do not dream,<br>
I assure you, my generation is already tired, <br>
you have turned our semen into venom.<br>
Already today we are tomorrow's ghosts,<br>
might that we could rise to haunt you.<br>
an army powdered with lime<br> 
stumbling from the bulldozer trenches<br>
where you will have laid our flesh to rot<P>

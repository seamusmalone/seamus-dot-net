When I was seven<BR>
Ilived in a house built at the turn of the century<BR>
below the porch<BR>
were cinders<BR>
the coal had been burnt in the furnace<BR>
before the war,<BR>
before they put in the gas main<p>

I would scrape my knees and palms<BR>
on the black bed of sharp edged coal corpses<BR>
lying like so many jews on the tiled furnace floor<BR>
It was here I would search for the past<BR>
in the deep shadow<BR> 
with catydid shells<BR>
hanging like broken lightbulbs<BR>
bound in a circuitry of spider webs<p>

It was here I would dig for<BR> 
the remnants of dinosaurs<BR>
I read about in a book my<BR>
that arrived in the mail from my Great Aunt<p>

I found a squirrel's skull once.<p>

Without Shoes<BR>
I walked for years in spectres form<BR>
across the belly of a flatland<BR>
of cinders, glass and metal<BR>
living as a nomad, without shelter<BR>
or food<p>

I have walked to the edge of a great body of water<BR>
and called up my cold skin<BR>
from below the water<BR>
rising on filaments of tangled hair<BR>
frozen and luminous<BR>
like a madmans chandalier of ice<p>

And the assumption of skin is so like the first few minutes <BR>
between the hard starched sheets<BR>
that have lain cold for months<BR>
on a bed far too big for my body<BR>
in the guestroom of my grandparents house<p>

The window cracked open,<BR>
January chills the smell<BR>
of staleness, age and oilsoap<BR>
my hair, electric on the stiff pillow<p>

My feet are black with cinder stains.<BR>
And the dust on the floor is so cold<BR>
I can feel it even below the blankets<p>

III.Questions for the Ribcage of Dawn

	<TD CLASS="itemtext">
At dawn I wake to ask the ribcage of sunlight <BR>
on the bedspread<BR> 
to write a new obituary<BR>
What stains I will carry<BR> 
and to what star will the cairn I build point<BR>
and to trace the history of my rebirth<BR>
to recieve where<BR> 
I have left my skin hanging to dry<BR>
a brittle ghost<BR>
caught in the high bare arms of a birch tree<BR>
I will ask the dawn to tell me<BR>
who will lay by me at nightfall?<BR>
which face will share my memory?<BR>
I will ask the dawn to tell me<BR>
who will entangle me at nightfall<BR>
what body will be twisted into my own<BR>
to bob as candle shadows<BR>
casting dark animal shapes,<BR>
filling the wall<BR>
and wrapping onto the cieling.

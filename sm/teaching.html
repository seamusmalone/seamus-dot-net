<P>
I teach art with a focus on the production of meaning, both in the creation and
the interpretation of work. I teach with an emphasis on the development of extralinguistic
communication skills, critical thinking (phenomenology, perception, viewer, embodiment)
I think these skills are the most fundamental for those seeking a career as 
a professional artist, but are ultimately no less valuable for students seeking
to use the arts as a secondary skill in their career, as an outlet for self 
exploration or greater cultural understanding.
</P> 
<P>
Our society fails to develop the interpretive apparatus necessary for students to 
both effectively communicate in non-linguistic media and to understand the communication
of others.

As such, students don't really understand their own works,
(expressive phallacy) the interpretations that others.
While 

or how to communicate media effectively through non-linguistic media
I attempt to give students a useful set of 
skills for interpreting works of art, both their own and others. culture (whether "high art" or popular/commercial)
and better understand their place in the production and transformation of 
social meaning, producing "their" meaning for someone else work of art or 
. Also, 
</P> 
<P>
This method also encourages students to to use their imagination to step into the shoes of 
someone else and understand how the meaning of a work might shift based on
subject position (based on racial, economic, cultural, gender identification).
The inevitable stereotypes, _ and assumed power relations of the dominant culture then
become "teachable moments" rather than __ of political correctness.


<!--
I believe, with enough effort and knowledge most students can attain a high
level of skill. While it is our job to help them find the beginning of that 
path, they must choose to make the commitment to walk it themselves.

Most members or our society, certainly most undergraduate students,
have a misunderstanding of the function of art in our society.  
The development of those skills necessary to
operate in a given media are addressed, but always secondary to the
intention of the work itself and its ability to express the intention of
the artist.
unconscious elements psycho-analytic and dialectical-phenomenology to understand
the place of their work in realtion to historical, social and cultural context
-->

</P> 
<P>Interpretive critiques are central to the development
of these abilities. In preparation for critiques students are asked to
write a one page artists statement outlining the ideas that they would
like to communicate to an audience. Once the work has been presented,
critiques begin with the audiences reaction to the work. These reactions
are neither qualitative appraisals of the works aesthetic merits nor ()
emotional reactions, but audience contributions toward answering the
question "what do you think the artist is saying". While I don't overtly
discourage emotional or aesthetic reaction, I attempt to prompt students
to see how these reactions contextualize and contribute to the meaning
of the work, rather than constitute a () reaction in themselves.</P>

<P>Once this part of the critique is finished and all opinions have been
expressed and several possibilities explored, the artist is asked to
read their artists statement. Finally we look at the discrepancies
between the audiences understanding of the work and the artists
intentions. We address both the successes and failures, if the audience
"got it" why? how? If they did not, what could the artist have to done
to address the misunderstandings, how could they have provided more
context or clues within the work that would have helped the audience
come closer to understanding his or her aims? Were there elements or
references</P> 

<P>Art lives at the interface of the audience and the
work... the artist is merely the  'first' and most important audience.
Certainly it is possible to do 'art-like-work' that only has personal
meaning. all meaning is social.</P> 

<P>Critiques are run with an
emphasis on developing an understanding of how others, without the
internal context are able to decode the meaning of their work. the
interpretation of others works at the same time coming to understand
</P> 

<P>In the process of production to consider audience reception,
what common language their audience might have to decode the work, and
to be aware of the audiences they are alienating.</P> 

<P>It would be a
misunderstanding to take all this talk about sign systems to
de-emphasize the practice of making art. The ability to create meaning
is ultimately in the material practices we engage. The denotative
language of essays, corporate reports, spreadsheets and computer
programs are only a very limited subset of the semiotic field, and yet
our society has tossed about deaf and mute in the world of material
signs.</P> 
<P>In fact denotative language within a piece is discouraged,
and generally shown to be crutch, made necessary by a failure to
understand that the same information could be communicated in the
"native media" of the work.</P> 

<P>Through this means, students not only
develop an understanding of their own art, but become more savvy
cultural consumers, capable of decoding the ideological subtext of the
non-verbal systems in which they are immersed, be it art, film,
architecture and television or more broadly those 'unthought' non-verbal
sign systems in which we all are embedded, professional,
public-political and interpersonal relationships.</P>
